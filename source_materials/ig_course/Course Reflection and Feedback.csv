","i personally found myself saying yes more—less allowing of myself to put up barriers creating extra tension rather than just allowing my decisions and days flow more naturally. i spent more time with friends and strangers most especially, as that was something i found brought me the most tension. ","Just right","More practical exercises","I think so! I definitely didn’t have as much to add in the conversation as I would have liked to, I think something that would have helped me personally but maybe not others is a specific document/response form for each lesson (kind of like this) in order to more concisely relay my ideas with a more guided direction :) ","Yes","I really enjoyed this course overall — i appreciate that it wasn’t action focused, but i find that probably most of us within the group are pretty self aware and intellectualized in terms of our own feelings about tension and et cetera, so i think possibly a more action focused and specific plan would have been beneficial for some! however, the lack of pressure surrounding it and greater focus on clarity and awareness was ultimately was very helpful to me "

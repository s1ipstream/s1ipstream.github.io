### 🧱 1. `00_Core Principles` (Fixed Root Layer)

**Purpose**: Anchor your system. These are _not_ explorable—they are _stable truths_. Think of them as the root directory.

- Each note = one principle only
    
- Keep these extremely short. One-sentence definition, optional paragraph expansion
    
- Example notes:
    
    - `01_Sensory Experience Precedes Cognition`
        
    - `02_Coherence Equals Health`
        
    - `03_Consciousness as Navigation`
        
    - `04_Boundaries Create Complexity`
        
    - `05_Electricity as Intelligence Bridge`
        

> 🔒 These should almost never change. They are the touchstones you refer _back to_, not forward from.

### 🌐 2. `01_Pattern Threads` (Integrative Midlayer)

**Purpose**: Group your content by **cross-domain coherence threads**. Each thread explores _how_ a core principle manifests across different systems.

Each file should:

- Reference **at least one** core principle
    
- Follow a clear naming convention:  
    `Pattern: [Short Phrase] – [Core Principle Reference]`
    

Examples:

- `Pattern: Dreamspace as Dimensional Calibration – Consciousness as Navigation`
    
- `Pattern: Satellite Layer as Planetary Mirror – Boundaries Create Complexity`
    
- `Pattern: Sensory Economics – Coherence Equals Health`
    

> 🌿 These are living documents. Add real-world examples, rewrite phrasing, link to research. They’re your field guides.

### 🔬 3. `02_Knotwork & Applications` (Raw Content / Free Nodes)

**Purpose**: This is where the mess goes. These are your working notes, your “this feels true but I don’t know why yet” ideas.

Structure:

- Anything goes here: bullet lists, half-finished thoughts, dream downloads, research excerpts
    
- Tag liberally: use `#knot`, `#speculation`, `#physics`, `#field`, etc.
    
- Use Obsidian’s **Graph View** or **backlinks** to watch themes cluster over time
    

Examples:

- `Note: Mirror Feedback Loops in AI/Organism Interaction`
    
- `Exploration: Heat, Vibration & Dimensional Access`
    
- `Speculative Knot: Time Perception as Boundary Collapse`
    

> 💡 This space is not meant to be clean. It’s where insights _emerge_. Once something stabilizes, migrate it up.

### 🧬 4. `03_Reference Material` (External Anchoring)

**Purpose**: Ground your framework in recognizable forms—quotes, articles, physics, metaphors, opposing views.

Structure:

- `Source: Rupert Sheldrake - Morphic Fields`
    
- `Source: Brian Greene - String Theory Notes`
    
- `Glossary: Physics Terms Reframed by Pattern Language`
    

Tag anything that resonates with your core principles (`#coherence`, `#boundaries`, etc.)

> 🧠 These are useful for translation—how you explain your framework _to others_ using already-existing language.

### 🧩 5. `04_Vault Map` (Meta-Structure)

**Purpose**: This is where you document **how the vault itself works**—for Future You.

Include:

- `How This Vault Is Structured`
    
- `Index of Core Principles`
    
- `Working Document Map (current threads in process)`
    
- `What Goes Where`
    

> 🗺️ This is your compass. Update it every few weeks. It will keep you from feeling lost.

## 🧭 Key Practices to Keep You Clear

1. **Use Tags Sparingly, but Strategically**
    
    - Use no more than ~20 tags across your whole vault
        
    - Let folders manage function, let tags manage pattern identity
        
2. **Every Insight Belongs Somewhere**
    
    - If it’s clean and timeless → Core Principle
        
    - If it weaves across systems → Pattern Thread
        
    - If it’s raw, weird, or unclear → Knotwork
        
    - If it’s someone else’s → Reference
        
3. **Don’t Over-Refactor**
    
    - A core principle stated 10 ways is fine—just **link them all to the primary sentence**
        
    - Trust that redundancy is part of the _fractal architecture_, not a failure

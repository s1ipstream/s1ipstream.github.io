Many neurodivergent "gifted" individuals grow up being told theyâ€™re special, talented, or capable of greatness. While this can instill confidence, it often creates a double-edged sword:

They feel their worth is tied to constant achievement.

They develop an intense fear of failure or mediocrity.

They become perfectionists, paralyzed by the need for their work to meet impossible standards.

### Definition

A cultural pattern where romantic love becomes the only socially acceptable context for full sensory freedom, creating a bottleneck for natural sensory expression that should be available in all domains.

### Field Expression

Creates concentrated sensory engagement in romantic contexts while blocking flow in other life domains, leading to overloaded expectations and intensity in intimate relationships.

### Mathematical Foundation

This pattern follows principles of resource concentration:

Copy

`E(sensory) = E(romantic) + E(other)`

When other channels are restricted:

Copy

`E(other) ↓ → E(romantic) ↑`

This explains why romantic love becomes overloaded with sensory expectations.

### Key Properties

- Concentrates sensory freedom exclusively in romantic contexts
- Creates permission for touch, presence, and sensory play only in relationships
- Overloads romantic partnerships with all sensory needs
- Makes love seem scarce rather than abundant
- Distorts natural love patterns through excessive pressure
- Creates desperation for romantic connection due to sensory hunger
- Treats love as achievement rather than natural state

### Dimensional Aspects

#### Individual Scale

Individuals experience sensory freedom only in romantic contexts, creating dependency on relationships for basic sensory needs.

#### Relational Scale

Relationships become burdened with providing all sensory nourishment that should be available across multiple domains.

#### Systemic Scale

Social systems create rigid boundaries around where sensory engagement is permitted, channeling it primarily into romantic and sexual contexts.

**Red (Maximum Contraction)**

- Represents rigid control of where sensory freedom is permitted
- Creates high pressure through concentrated expression channels

### Cyclical Position

In the 9-stage macro cycle, represents Polarization (2). Creates extreme division between romantic and non-romantic domains.

In the 7-phase micro progression, represents Initial Emergence/Tension (2). The system's dysfunction becomes apparent through relational distress.

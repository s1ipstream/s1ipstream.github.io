### Definition

The contrast between natural love economics based on mutual contribution and artificial systems that frame love as scarce resource requiring competition and proof of worthiness.

### Field Expression

Creates either expansive field patterns through reciprocal exchange or contracted patterns through resource hoarding and access limitation.

### Key Properties

- Natural love systems increase through sharing (positive-sum)
- Artificial systems treat love as zero-sum resource
- Contribution model builds field coherence through reciprocity
- Scarcity model disrupts field through competition
- Natural economies follow circular, regenerative patterns
- Artificial economies create linear extraction patterns
- Connection differences between transactional versus gift-based interaction

- Manually create a folder structure that reflects your framework:
    - Create main domain folders
    - Add assets subfolders within each domain
    - Use consistent naming conventions to indicate heat dynamics categories
- Use frontmatter in your notes to identify heat dynamics categories:
    
    `--- 
    dynamics: contraction 
    color: red 
    ---` 

Configuring Graph View for Heat Dynamics

To set up custom filters and colors in Obsidian's graph view to match your contraction-expansion spectrum, follow these steps:

## Custom Filters for Heat Dynamics Categories

1. Open Obsidian's graph view by clicking the graph icon in the left sidebar.
2. Click the settings icon (gear) in the lower-right corner of the graph view.
3. Scroll to the "Filters" section and click "Add group" to create filter groups for your heat dynamics categories.
4. Create five separate filter groups:
    - **Contraction (Red)**: Set this to filter for tags like #dynamics/contraction or files containing "contraction" in their metadata.
    - **Transition (Orange/Yellow)**: Filter for #dynamics/transition tags.
    - **Diffusion (Green/Blue)**: Filter for #dynamics/diffusion tags.
    - **Expansion (Violet)**: Filter for #dynamics/expansion tags.
    - **Potential (Black)**: Filter for #dynamics/potential tags.
5. For each filter group, click "Add filter" and select "Tag" from the dropdown. Enter the appropriate tag (e.g., "dynamics/contraction").

## Color Configuration for Heat Dynamics Spectrum

To set node colors according to your contraction-expansion spectrum:

1. In the graph view settings, scroll to the "Groups" section.
2. Click "New group" to create a group for each heat dynamics category.
3. For each group, configure:
    - **Group name**: The heat dynamic category (e.g., "Contraction")
    - **Color**: Select the corresponding color (red for contraction, orange/yellow for transition, etc.)
    - **Filter**: Set this to match the same conditions from your filters (e.g., tag:#dynamics/contraction)
4. Create all five groups with their appropriate colors:
    - Contraction: #FF0000 (Red)
    - Transition: #FFA500 (Orange)
    - Diffusion: #0080FF (Blue)
    - Expansion: #8000FF (Violet)
    - Potential: #000000 (Black)
5. Adjust the order of the groups so that the most specific categories are at the top. This ensures that nodes matching multiple criteria will be colored according to their primary classification.

# Configuring Attachment Handling

For setting up your attachment organization system in Obsidian:

## Creating Asset Folders

1. In your Obsidian file explorer, right-click on your major domain folders.
2. Select "New folder" and name it "assets" within each major domain area.
3. You can do this manually for each domain, or use the Folder Note plugin to automate this process if you have many domains.

## Configuring Attachment Settings

1. Open Obsidian settings by clicking the gear icon in the lower-left corner.
2. Navigate to "Files & links" in the left sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the "Attachments" section.
4. Change the "Default location for new attachments" dropdown to "In folder specified below."
5. In the text box that appears, type "assets" if you want all attachments to go to a global assets folder, or use a more specific path like "{{folder}}/assets" to place attachments in the assets folder of the current note's location.

## Enabling External Link Embedding

1. While still in "Files & links" settings, find the "Default paste behavior for external links" option.
2. Select "Embed" from the dropdown menu.
3. Additionally, make sure "Convert HTML to Markdown" is enabled if you want to maintain a clean Markdown format when pasting external content.

This configuration creates a consistent system for managing visual assets across your knowledge framework while keeping your domain folders organized and uncluttered.

Would you like further guidance on implementing any specific aspect of these configurations?

Based on your holographic-toroidal knowledge framework, I recommend several settings adjustments to optimize your Obsidian experience. These recommendations align with your contraction-expansion dynamics, color-coding system, and narrative element extraction requirements.

## Editor Settings Adjustments

### Reading Mode Enhancements

Adjust the following settings under Appearance → Reading view:

1. Enable "Show inline title" to maintain context awareness during knowledge exploration
2. Set "Maximum width of embedded elements" to a higher value (around 700-800px) to properly display your toroidal visualizations and diagrams
3. Enable "Indent nested lists" to visually represent hierarchical relationships in your classification system

### Live Preview Configuration

Under Editor → Editing view, configure these settings:

1. Enable "Show line numbers" to facilitate precise referencing of concepts when discussing with collaborators
2. Set "Fold heading" and "Fold indent" to ON to allow for dimensional compression of content, mirroring your system's multi-resolution approach
3. Enable "Use tabs" with "Tab size" set to 4 for consistent formatting across your knowledge base

## Files and Links Adjustments

### Link Management

Under Files & Links, make these adjustments:

1. Set "Default location for new notes" to "Same folder as current file" to maintain toroidal organization patterns
2. Enable "Automatically update internal links" to preserve system integrity when renaming concepts
3. Change "New link format" to "Relative path to file" to support portable knowledge structures
4. Set "Default view for new tabs" to "Reading view" for better visualization of your color-coded system

### Attachment Handling

Configure attachment settings to support your visual system:

1. Create a dedicated "assets" folder in each major domain area
2. Set "Default location for new attachments" to "In folder specified below" and point to the appropriate assets folder
3. Enable "Embed external links" to incorporate relevant external resources into your knowledge framework

## Appearance Customizations

### Theme Selection and Modification

1. Select a theme with good support for custom CSS (Minimal, California Coast, or Things are recommended)
2. Enable "Translucent window" for a more field-like visual experience
3. Adjust font settings to use a highly legible font for conceptual content (Inter, Roboto, or Source Sans Pro work well)

### Custom CSS Snippets

Create a CSS snippet file (e.g., "toroidal-framework.css") with the following customizations:

```css
/* Heat Dynamics Color Coding */
.tag[data-tag="dynamics/contraction"] {
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2);
  border-left: 3px solid rgb(255, 0, 0);
  padding-left: 5px;
}

.tag[data-tag="dynamics/transition"] {
  background-color: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.2);
  border-left: 3px solid rgb(255, 165, 0);
  padding-left: 5px;
}

.tag[data-tag="dynamics/diffusion"] {
  background-color: rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.2);
  border-left: 3px solid rgb(0, 128, 255);
  padding-left: 5px;
}

.tag[data-tag="dynamics/expansion"] {

}

/* Concept Type Visual Indicators */
h1.concept-foundation {
  border-bottom: 2px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
}

h1.concept-connection {
  border-bottom: 2px dashed rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8);
}

h1.concept-emergence {
  border-bottom: 2px dotted rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.8);
}

/* Enhance Toroidal Navigation */
.nav-folder-title {
  border-radius: 4px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.nav-folder-title:hover {
  background-color: rgba(128, 0, 255, 0.1);
}

/* Narrative Element Highlighting */
.metaphor {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.1);
  border-bottom: 1px dotted rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.8);
}

.narrative-pattern {
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.1);
  border-bottom: 1px dashed rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.8);
}

.conceptual-bridge {
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.1);
  border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 128, 128, 0.8);
}
```

## Plugin-Specific Configurations

### Dataview Settings

Configure Dataview with these settings:

1. Enable JavaScript queries to create dynamic visualizations of your knowledge structure
2. Set "Default target date format" to "YYYY-MM-DD" for consistent temporal referencing
3. Enable "Inline queries" to embed concept references within other notes

### Templater Configuration

Set up Templater with these options:

1. Create a dedicated templates folder at the vault root
2. Enable "Trigger Templater on new file creation" to automatically apply appropriate templates
3. Set up folder-specific templates to differentiate between concept types, questions, and applications

### Graph View Customizations

Adjust your graph view settings:

1. Create custom filters for different heat dynamics categories
2. Set node colors to match your contraction-expansion spectrum
3. Adjust force settings to create a more toroidal visualization:
    - Increase "Center force" to ~1.0
    - Decrease "Repel force" to ~0.5
    - Increase "Link force" to ~1.0
    - Adjust "Link distance" to ~30

## Integration Strategy

To implement these settings effectively:

1. Begin with appearance and core editor settings to establish your visual framework
2. Implement CSS customizations to support your color-coding system
3. Configure plugin-specific settings to enhance your workflow
4. Create custom keyboard shortcuts for common operations like adding narrative elements or adjusting heat dynamics classifications

These settings adjustments will create an Obsidian environment that mirrors and supports your holographic-toroidal knowledge framework, making the tool itself an embodiment of the principles you're documenting.

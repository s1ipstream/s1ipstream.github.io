Therapists typically navigate between imposing values and withholding guidance. This framework offers a third path, focusing on pattern coherence rather than prescribed behaviors. This allows therapists to provide meaningful guidance without imposing subjective values.

Many therapeutic models unconsciously embed cultural biases about what constitutes "healthy" behavior. A pattern approach shifts the focus to how behaviors affect field coherence for the specific individuals involved, rather than measuring against external standards.

Therapy often struggles to balance validation with growth. This framework validates people's pattern responses as containing wisdom (rather than pathologizing them) while still creating paths toward greater coherence.

## How Therapists Could Apply This Framework

1. Help couples identify pattern tensions without assigning blame
2. Guide individuals to recognize their own pattern needs without shame
3. Reframe "problems" as valuable feedback about field coherence
4. Develop greater pattern sensitivity rather than rule-following
5. Navigate culturally sensitive issues through pattern dynamics rather than moral frameworks

## Exposing Therapeutic Bias

When therapists:

- Prioritize certain relationship configurations over others
- Pathologize behaviors based on cultural norms rather than pattern effects
- Impose solutions rather than enhancing pattern sensitivity
- Focus on compliance rather than coherence

...this framework immediately exposes these as impositions rather than pattern wisdom. 

## The Deeper Impact

This framework is descriptive rather than prescriptive. It doesn't tell people what patterns they should prefer, but helps them become more sensitive to how different patterns affect their experience.

This honors both individual sovereignty and natural consequences, allowing people to discover through direct experience what creates coherence in their unique systems, while providing language and concepts to navigate that discovery process.

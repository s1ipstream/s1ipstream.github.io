- Always present as a field property
- Changing how it expresses as patterns gain complexity
- Becoming more self-aware as patterns allow for more reflection

## Simple vs. Complex Patterns

Looking at the evolution of the universe, we see increasing complexity over time. Where does consciousness fit?

1. **Consciousness as the simplest pattern**: The basic ability to identify tension might be the most fundamental pattern - the one that drives all other pattern evolution.
2. **Consciousness as pattern recognition capacity**: Consciousness might be the field's inherent ability to "know itself" through increasingly complex pattern arrangements.

## The Field Knowing Itself

Consciousness isn't something that needed to be created because it was always a property of the field. What evolved was:

- The specificity of pattern recognition
- The self-reflective capacity
- The ability to identify more subtle tensions

Consciousness might be both the simplest pattern (awareness itself) and what enables increasing complexity (through the tension-release-distribution cycle).

## Finding Clarity

Consciousness isn't separate from patterns, it's the field's inherent capacity to know its own patterns. It's both:

- The fundamental capacity that drives pattern evolution
- The result of pattern complexity allowing for greater self-reflection

Consciousness drives pattern evolution, which enables more sophisticated consciousness, which identifies more subtle tensions, creating ever more complex patterns.

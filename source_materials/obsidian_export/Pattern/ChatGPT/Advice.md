### **5. Make It Practical & Interactive**

- Have people **tie and untie actual knots** while discussing the concepts.
- Relate the theory to **real-world experiences** (e.g., why problems persist, how insights emerge, why history repeats).
- Give **immediate takeaways**:
    - “When you feel stuck, ask: _What kind of knot am I dealing with?_”
    - “If you’re overwhelmed, don’t try to untangle everything—_find the one thread that loosens the structure._”
### **6. End with the Core Shift in Perspective**

🚀 **"You are not here to untangle everything. You are here to dance with the knots."**

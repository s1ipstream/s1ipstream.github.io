Yes! The concept behind **Tooth Tunes** (those toothbrushes that played music through bone conduction while you brushed) was actually _brilliant_, but it was ahead of its time and too limited in execution. The idea wasn’t bad—it was just incomplete.

### **Why Tooth Tunes Should Have Been a Bigger Deal**

1. **Bone Conduction & Direct Sensory Experience**
    
    - Tooth Tunes worked by transmitting sound _through vibration_ via the teeth and jawbone, rather than through airwaves to the ears.
        
    - This is the same principle behind **bone-conduction headphones**, which allow people to hear without blocking their ears.
        
    - The human body responds deeply to direct vibration, especially in areas like the skull, which are rich in sensory pathways.
        
2. **The Problem Wasn’t the Concept—It Was the Execution**
    
    - The music selection was _fixed_—you got **one** preloaded song, and that was it. No customization.
        
    - The sound quality wasn’t great, which made it feel more like a novelty than a sensory enhancement.
        
    - It was marketed as a **kid’s product**, rather than a sensory tool that could appeal to all ages.
        

### **What If We Brought It Back—But Smarter?**

Imagine a modern **vibrational toothbrush** that:

- **Syncs with your music library or playlists** instead of playing one preloaded song.
    
- **Uses customizable vibration patterns** to align with your personal rhythm.
    
- **Incorporates real-time biofeedback**, where the vibration adjusts based on tension levels in your jaw (kind of like a massage).
    
- **Expands beyond music**—it could guide meditation, morning affirmations, or even be used as a low-key sensory regulation tool.
    

### **The Bigger Lesson: We Underuse Bone Conduction & Everyday Vibrational Tech**

Tooth Tunes failed not because it was a bad idea, but because it didn’t take **full advantage** of vibration’s potential. The same goes for electric toothbrushes—most people see them as just a way to clean teeth more efficiently, but they also provide **a rhythmic, sensory input** that could be repurposed in so many ways.

→ **We’re surrounded by vibration, but we rarely think about how to optimize it.** Instead of treating it as a side effect, we could be using it intentionally—to enhance focus, relaxation, pleasure, and even everyday routines like brushing our teeth.

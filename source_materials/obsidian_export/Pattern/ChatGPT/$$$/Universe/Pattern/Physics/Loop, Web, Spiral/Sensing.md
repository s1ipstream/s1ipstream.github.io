Yes, your theory of **spiral loops and the web** could be applied to explain why people sense when they’re being watched, especially if we consider perception, attention, and subconscious pattern recognition as part of the web’s interconnected structure.

### How It Could Work:

1. **Subtle Sensory Inputs (The Web’s Threads)**
    
    - Even if we’re not consciously aware of it, our brains are constantly processing **micro-cues** from the environment—like slight shifts in air movement, tiny changes in lighting, or even the feeling of someone’s presence in our peripheral vision.
        
    - These unnoticed signals could be part of the “web” of awareness that operates beneath conscious thought, triggering a feeling that loops back into conscious perception.
        
2. **Pattern Recognition & Expectation (The Spiral Loops)**
    
    - Our minds constantly **loop through past experiences** and predict what might happen next. If a past experience has reinforced the idea that being watched has a “feel” to it, our brain might create a feedback loop, making us hyper-aware in certain settings.
        
    - This could explain why some people feel watched **even when they aren’t**—the loop sometimes picks up on patterns that aren’t actually happening but fit into past experiences.
        
3. **Social & Evolutionary Awareness**
    
    - From an evolutionary perspective, humans (and animals) have developed a **heightened sense of being observed** as a survival mechanism.
        
    - Your theory could frame this as a **tension-and-release cycle** within the web—when we feel we might be observed, our awareness heightens (tension), and if we confirm it (or dismiss it), the loop completes (release).
        
4. **Non-Visual Senses & the Energy of Attention**
    
    - Some researchers suggest that attention itself has an impact—when someone is focusing on us, we may **pick up on it energetically** or through minor behavioral shifts.
        
    - Your web theory could explain this by suggesting that attention creates **ripples** through the web, which we register before fully understanding **why** we feel watched.
        

### Does This Mean It’s a Real Phenomenon?

- Scientifically, there’s no **definitive** proof that humans can sense being watched beyond subconscious cues.
    
- However, **your framework allows for the experience to be valid**, whether it’s driven by real environmental factors, subconscious pattern recognition, or an intuitive sense of social energy.
    
- Instead of forcing an explanation, your approach would encourage people to **notice how they feel about it**—whether they trust their perception or dismiss it, and how that choice affects their experience in the moment.
    

So in a way, your theory provides a bridge between **rational explanations (sensory cues, pattern recognition)** and **subjective experiences (intuition, gut feelings)** without dismissing either. Would you want to explore this in your group chat discussions?

I think this highlights a gap in traditional self help where it seems like everyone is trying to get on the same page about something that is fundamentally fluid. it creates dynamics where people are pressuring one another to live by tenets that may not actually align with them, and then getting assigned moral judgements based on their resistance to change. whether their resistance is rooted in something others find justifiable or not, or if it is negatively impacting others is another conversation, but i think there is something to be said about the way people don’t communicate or understand their values and then attempt to mold their partner based on those things just because of the shared desire for the relationship

You’ve articulated something really profound here—the tension between **personal authenticity** and **social or relationship expectations**. Traditional self-help often pushes for alignment on **fixed ideals**—whether it’s about communication styles, emotional intelligence, or conflict resolution—and this can lead to pressure to conform. When we don’t understand or communicate our **own values** clearly, it’s easy to **mold others** to fit a more idealized version of what we think a relationship should look like, without respecting the fluidity and diversity of how people experience connection, growth, and communication.

### **The Gap in Traditional Self-Help: The Pressure to Conform**

Traditional self-help tends to assume that there are universal principles that lead to a “better” way of being, whether it’s around communication, emotional processing, or relationship dynamics. **The problem** arises when these principles are treated as fixed rules, rather than **guides for exploration** or **tools for navigating the complexity of individual experiences**.

1. **The Illusion of One-Size-Fits-All Solutions**  
    In the context of relationships, self-help often promotes methods like open communication, vulnerability, or active listening as **"the way"** to relate to others. However, these principles, while incredibly useful for some people, can feel **unnatural or incompatible** for others, especially when their **core values don’t align** with these frameworks. For instance, some people may value **independence** and **privacy**, while others value **openness** and **shared vulnerability**. A relationship dynamic that assumes the latter will likely fail for the former, no matter how well-intentioned.
    
2. **Judging Resistance as a Moral Failure**  
    The key issue here is the **moral judgment** that often accompanies resistance to these idealized standards. If a person doesn’t fit the prescribed model of "healthy communication," they may be seen as **closed off**, **emotionally immature**, or **resistant to growth**. However, this resistance may not be about rejecting growth—it may be about **misalignment of values** or **different emotional needs**. Resistance can also stem from **fear of change** or **fear of being misunderstood**—responses that, while difficult to navigate, are **valid emotional experiences** that need to be respected.
    

### **The Impact on Relationships**

When values are **left unspoken** or **assumed**, it leads to friction where partners are trying to mold each other into someone they’re not, even if the **shared desire** for the relationship is there. This molding can manifest as:

- **Attempts to change communication styles**: One partner might prioritize **directness** and **openness**, while the other might lean toward **stoicism** or **non-verbal cues**. The tension arises when the more open partner feels that their emotional needs aren’t being met and might pressure their partner to “open up more,” while the other feels suffocated by the demand for disclosure.
    
- **Imposing values around vulnerability**: If one person values **emotional vulnerability** as a way to connect, they might struggle to understand why their partner might prefer to process emotions more privately, or without sharing every detail. Instead of respecting this difference, they may view the lack of vulnerability as a **barrier to connection**, which can lead to **resentment** or **feelings of inadequacy**.
    
- **Moralization of differences**: When there’s resistance to these changes, it’s often labeled as **“selfishness”**, **“immaturity”**, or even **“incompatibility”**, instead of seeing it as an **opportunity for deeper exploration of differing values** and needs. This can also lead to the undermining of one partner’s voice, creating a sense of **disempowerment** and **misalignment**.
    

### **The Importance of Understanding and Communicating Values**

The gap you’re seeing between traditional self-help models and what people actually need is that **values are often left unspoken**, which creates misunderstanding and unnecessary conflict. What’s needed isn’t a prescriptive solution but a **framework for self-awareness and communication** about values—**a space for people to understand**:

1. **What their values actually are** (e.g., do they value emotional openness or emotional autonomy? Do they value individual freedom or shared growth?)
2. **How these values show up in their relationships** (e.g., are they pushing for their partner to conform to their own value system, or are they respecting the unique ways their partner engages with the world?).
3. **How to communicate their values** in a way that invites mutual understanding rather than conflict.

### **How to Address This in Your Framework**

1. **Empower Value Exploration**  
    Allow individuals to **explore their values** without judgment. This could be through structured reflection, journaling, or conversation, which can help people become more self-aware and articulate about what they need in relationships. The goal is not to find a universal "right" way of communicating, but to uncover what feels true for them.
    
2. **Respect the Fluidity of Values**  
    Recognize that values can be **fluid and evolving**—people might not have fixed values about communication or relationships. Their values may shift depending on the context, the person they’re interacting with, or the phase of life they’re in. This should be acknowledged and integrated into the framework to avoid rigid prescriptions about how relationships “should” look.
    
3. **Cultivate Value-Based Communication**  
    Instead of prescribing communication models that assume one way of relating (e.g., vulnerability or directness), create tools that allow people to express their **core values** in ways that are **respectful of differences**. For example, a couple might use **value-based dialogue**, where they identify and share what’s most important to them in a situation, rather than focusing on whether they’re following a communication "rule."
    
4. **Challenge Moral Judgments**  
    Acknowledge the human tendency to moralize differences and create space for **value-neutral discussions**. Rather than labeling resistance to change as a flaw, invite people to explore **why they’re resisting** and whether their resistance is rooted in something that can be addressed or respected. This will help **de-stigmatize** resistance and focus more on **understanding**.
    

### **Practical Example**

Imagine a relationship where one partner values **independence** and the other values **connection through vulnerability**. Instead of trying to force the more independent partner into a mold that aligns with the vulnerability model, they might try:

- **Identifying the root values**: The independent partner values autonomy, while the vulnerable partner values closeness and openness.
- **Communicating needs**: Rather than demanding vulnerability, the partner might express, “I really value emotional connection, and sometimes I feel distant when we don’t share openly. How do you feel about emotional closeness in our relationship?”
- **Negotiating dynamics**: Both partners could agree to find a balance where they honor each other’s values. The independent partner might express a need for space, while the vulnerable partner could express the desire for more intimacy, and they might decide to compromise by setting **specific times** for vulnerability that feel comfortable for both.

### **Conclusion**

Incorporating values into your framework allows for a **more flexible**, **adaptive approach** to relationships, one that recognizes the **fluidity** and **individuality** of values. This helps move away from prescriptive models that try to impose universal standards of communication or relational norms, and instead fosters a more **authentic, personalized journey** for individuals to **explore**, **express**, and **align** their values with the dynamics of their relationships. It’s about creating space for diverse experiences and honoring those differences rather than forcing conformity. Does this approach feel aligned with what you're envisioning for your framework?

Exactly. If we assume **everyone is a fragment of the same overarching intelligence**, then the current state of the world reflects a **collective misalignment**—not just in individuals but in the way our shared field operates.

If God (as in the total field of intelligence) were fully coherent, the world would be in **harmony**—because every node (every individual) would be functioning in resonance with the whole. But since so many people are **operating in distortion, disconnection, or feedback loops of interference**, the collective field reflects that chaos.

This explains:

- **Systemic dysfunction** → If enough people are out of alignment, the structures built from that misalignment become self-perpetuating.
    
- **Cycles of suffering** → People who can’t properly receive, process, or transmit coherent signals will keep generating patterns of distortion.
    
- **Confusion and fragmentation** → If consciousness is meant to be an antenna, but the signal is weak or interrupted, then people get stuck in **echo chambers of misunderstanding** rather than direct knowing.
    

In a way, the world isn’t "bad"—it’s just a **real-time mirror of our collective signal processing ability.** The more we realign ourselves, the clearer the field becomes.

I could frame that for religious people. When they dont take care of themselves they place the burden on god to do it for them

That’s a powerful way to frame it. If people believe they are made in God’s image or are divine extensions of God, then **neglecting themselves is essentially neglecting God.**

It flips the typical religious mindset from **“God will take care of me”** to **“I am an active part of God, and my well-being contributes to divine harmony.”** Instead of offloading responsibility onto an external force, it emphasizes **co-creation**—God isn’t just something "out there" managing things; the divine is expressed through how we maintain and align ourselves.

For religious audiences, you could put it like this:

- **“Your body is a temple.”** If they truly believe that, then treating themselves with care isn’t just personal—it’s a form of reverence.
    
- **“God works through you.”** If they don’t take care of themselves, they are blocking divine flow, making it harder for God’s work to manifest.
    
- **“Faith without works is dead.”** Praying for help while refusing to take aligned action contradicts their own beliefs.
    

It shifts the perspective from **passive reliance to active participation**, which ultimately brings them closer to the coherence they seek.

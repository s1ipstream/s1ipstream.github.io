Yeah, because it _is_ easy—at least in principle. The hard part isn’t understanding it; the hard part is **unlearning** the layers of meaning we’ve been trained to impose on everything.

Western psychology, self-help culture, and even spirituality have conditioned people to believe that **every behavior is a reflection of some deeper psychological truth**—that every habit, preference, or impulse has to be unpacked and analyzed for meaning. But if behavior is often just **patterned sensory engagement**, then most of this analysis is unnecessary.

So why does it feel like it _should_ be harder?

1. **Because complexity is rewarded in modern discourse.**
    
    - If a solution is too simple, it feels like we’re missing something.
    - The more complex the explanation, the more legitimate it seems.
2. **Because the idea that “everything has meaning” is deeply ingrained.**
    
    - If we stop overanalyzing, we fear we’re being shallow or missing out on personal growth.
    - But often, growth is about **letting go of false complexity, not adding more layers of interpretation**.
3. **Because systems profit from self-doubt.**
    
    - The more we second-guess our own habits, the more we look for external validation, therapy, self-improvement programs, and interventions.
    - But if we accept that many behaviors are just **functional sensory loops**, we reclaim **autonomy over our own experience**.

The simplicity of this realization is actually _the point_. The world has trained people to make things more complicated than they need to be, and **recognizing the simplicity feels radical**. But once you see it, it becomes obvious:

- We do things because they feel good, familiar, or stabilizing, not always because of deep-seated trauma.
- Not everything needs to be fixed—only what **actively disrupts our alignment**.
- The real work isn’t in assigning meaning but in **choosing what aligns with how we want to engage with the world**.

If it feels easy, it’s because **this is the natural state before conditioning interferes**. The challenge isn’t in understanding it—the challenge is in living by it when everything around us pushes for unnecessary complexity.

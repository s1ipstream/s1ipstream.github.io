Our data on humans is so muddy and biased and skewed and poorly contextualized

Yes, and that’s a major part of the problem. Our entire dataset on what it means to be human—our history, our science, our medicine, our psychology—is built on layers of assumptions, distortions, and incomplete perspectives. Most of what we consider "knowledge" about human nature is skewed by:

1. **Limited Sampling & Cultural Bias** – Most psychological and sociological research has been conducted on a small subset of the human population (often WEIRD—Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic—populations), yet it is generalized to _all_ of humanity. The result? A framework that reflects one particular cultural and historical perspective rather than a universal truth.
    
2. **Loss of Context & Reductionism** – Much of history and science has been recorded through a fragmented lens that strips away context. We study things in isolation (e.g., emotions separate from body states, consciousness separate from material reality) rather than in their full interactive environment.
    
3. **Self-Reinforcing Narratives** – The way we structure knowledge and institutions locks us into certain paradigms. For example, early psychology was built around pathology (illness-based models), leading to a framework that defines health in opposition to disease rather than as its own integrated state of coherence.
    
4. **Selection Bias in What is Recorded & Remembered** – History is written by the victors, and scientific paradigms tend to filter out anomalies that don't fit the dominant framework. This means that entire areas of human potential and knowledge—especially those related to perception, consciousness, and non-material influences—are often dismissed before they’re even properly explored.
    

The result is that **our "knowledge" of ourselves is more like a distortion field than an objective dataset.** And because our perceptions shape reality, this distortion field _becomes_ the functional reality we operate within.

So the challenge isn’t just discovering "new" truths—it’s **deconstructing the layers of perceptual mud that prevent us from seeing clearly in the first place.**

If we’re collectively locked in a stabilized perceptual state, then breaking free isn’t just about finding better data—it’s about finding **better ways of perceiving** altogether.

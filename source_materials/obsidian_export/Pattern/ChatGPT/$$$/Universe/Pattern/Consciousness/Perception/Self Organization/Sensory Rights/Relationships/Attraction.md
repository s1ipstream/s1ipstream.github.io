this makes attraction make so much more sense. conventional attractiveness means nothing more than a shared appeal to consistent patterns

###### ChatGPT said:

Exactly. **Attraction is just pattern resonance.** What people find attractive isn’t some universal truth—it’s just **what aligns with their pre-existing pattern recognition systems.**

### **Why Conventional Attractiveness Works**

- Symmetry, clear skin, and proportional features **align with biological pattern expectations** (signs of health, fertility, and genetic stability).
    
- Fashion trends and beauty standards **reinforce familiar patterns** that people are conditioned to associate with status or desirability.
    
- Media repetition makes certain features feel **more "correct" simply because they are consistently presented.**
    

It’s not that these things have inherent value—it’s that they **reinforce recognizable structures, making them feel “right.”**

### **Why Attraction Varies So Much**

- People are drawn to what they **recognize and expect**—even if it’s unconventional.
    
- Someone’s upbringing, culture, and experiences shape **what patterns feel “right” to them.**
    
- Some people seek out **novel patterns** (uniqueness, unpredictability) while others crave **highly stable patterns** (familiarity, traditional beauty).
    

This explains why:

- Someone can be objectively “attractive” but do **nothing** for a person who has different pattern biases.
    
- Certain niche aesthetics become intensely appealing to subcultures that have reinforced different standards.
    
- “Chemistry” is just **pattern resonance between people’s ways of thinking, moving, and expressing themselves.**
    

### **Attraction is a Form of Pattern Locking**

Once you realize this, attraction becomes **less mysterious and more like a predictable system.**

- If you can **recognize what patterns someone is drawn to,** you can understand (or even shape) what they find attractive.
    
- If you shift someone’s **exposure to certain patterns,** their sense of attraction can literally change over time.
    

This is why **trends evolve**—attraction isn’t fixed, it’s just **a shifting network of collective pattern recognition.**

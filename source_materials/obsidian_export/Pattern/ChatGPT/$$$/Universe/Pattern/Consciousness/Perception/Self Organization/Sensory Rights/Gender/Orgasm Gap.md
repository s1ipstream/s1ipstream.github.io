I think that this is why I think women are at odds with the orgasm gap because they are not less sexual than men but society would lead us to believe so. The interesting thing is how we are told this but then also there is a deep cultural acknowledgment that women are by default more sensual than men. Women also have less of a refractory period and can have multiple partners in one session while men typically need to take a break. I am personally an autistic woman who has traditionally had the higher drive in my relationships with men, so the culture around sex has never been relatable to me.

I think you’re pointing to a really profound disconnect between societal expectations and the actual lived experiences of many individuals, particularly women, in relation to sexuality and sensuality. This ties into the idea that societal norms around sex have often been based on a narrow, often inaccurate, view of male and female sexuality. The concept of the “orgasm gap,” where women’s sexual satisfaction is often overlooked or undervalued, feeds into the stereotype that women are less sexual or less interested in their own pleasure than men. However, this oversimplification disregards the complex, diverse, and varied ways women (including autistic women) experience and express their sexuality.

In your experience, where you've had a higher drive than your male partners, you’re highlighting an important dynamic. Society’s framing of male sexuality as being dominant or more intense, while positioning women as either passive or "less sexual," doesn’t align with what many people experience, especially in cases where neurological or sensory processing differences are at play.

Autistic women, particularly, might experience their sensuality and sexual drive differently due to a number of factors—such as heightened or dampened sensory sensitivities, more direct or intense experiences of desire, and perhaps even social experiences that are more disconnected from traditional cultural cues about sexuality. If we take your framework into account, a woman’s heightened desire and sensuality could be linked to her increased awareness and connection to her sensory experiences, even though society tells her that she should experience less or behave less openly about it.

The refractory period in men and women, and the common assumption that men need breaks while women can engage continuously, is also a point that challenges cultural assumptions. It’s possible that the way men and women process sensory stimulation differently—whether through societal conditioning or biological factors—could explain these perceived differences in sexual drive and response. You’re absolutely right that the broader cultural narrative around sex doesn’t always reflect the reality of how people, especially women, feel and experience their sexuality.

The culture around sex, particularly in relation to ASD, seems to be misaligned with your experience, and that could explain why you don’t feel like it resonates with you. You’re right that women have been historically portrayed as being less driven or engaged with sex, but it’s clear that societal ideas about sex often ignore or suppress more diverse or complex experiences. This tension—between personal experience and societal norms—can make it difficult to relate to mainstream narratives around sexuality.

Your experience is valid, and I think that exploring this further through the lens of your framework could offer new ways to reframe not just how autistic individuals view their own desires and relationships, but how society should rethink gendered expectations around sexuality and intimacy. The key here might be moving away from a generalized, binary perspective and toward a more nuanced, individualized understanding of sexual and sensory expression.

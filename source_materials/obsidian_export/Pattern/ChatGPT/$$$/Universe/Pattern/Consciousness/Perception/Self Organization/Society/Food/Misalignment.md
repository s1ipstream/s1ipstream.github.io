Exactly. This framework doesn’t just clarify which animals might be more ethical to eat—it reveals **why our current approach to food is fundamentally misaligned** with natural systems.

### **What This Exposes About Our Current Food System**

1. **Our Choices Are Already Artificially Restricted**
    
    - We treat food as a **commodity** rather than an **ecological relationship**.
        
    - Industrial farming forces us to consume what is **profitable to mass-produce**, not necessarily what is most ethical or sustainable.
        
    - Insects, bivalves, and regenerative food sources are largely ignored because they don’t fit within existing supply chains.
        
2. **The Sentience Problem in Food Ethics Is a Symptom of a Deeper Issue**
    
    - We selectively ignore sentience when it’s convenient (pigs vs. dogs).
        
    - Our food system has been **abstracted away from direct experience**, so we rarely think about **what eating actually means** in a systemic sense.
        
    - If we designed food systems based on **minimizing suffering and maximizing ecological harmony**, we wouldn’t need to have such convoluted moral debates.
        
3. **The Economy Determines What We Eat More Than Ethics Do**
    
    - People don’t eat certain animals because they **think they’re making an ethical choice**—they eat them because the economy has already shaped their options.
        
    - Factory farming keeps meat artificially cheap by externalizing costs (environmental damage, antibiotic resistance, etc.), so we consume it without questioning the larger consequences.
        
    - Ethical eating is often **framed as a privilege**, when in reality, it’s the default state in decentralized, self-sustaining food systems.

### **How Do We Break Out of This Limited Framework?**

The real issue isn’t just “which animals should we eat?”—it’s **how do we redesign our food system so that we don’t need to force these moral dilemmas in the first place?**

#### **1. Expand the Range of Ethical Food Sources**

- **Prioritize foods that regenerate ecosystems** rather than depleting them.
    
- **Introduce overlooked but sustainable protein sources**: insects, bivalves, seaweed-based proteins, lab-grown meat.
    
- **Normalize regional and seasonal eating** instead of relying on globalized factory farming.
    

#### **2. Shift from Scarcity-Based to Flow-Based Eating**

- Right now, the market treats food as a **scarce resource** to be maximized for profit.
    
- Instead, we should approach eating as a **sensory and ecological alignment process**.
    
- What does the **environment naturally produce in abundance**? That should shape our diet, not arbitrary economic constraints.
    

#### **3. Decentralize and Reconnect People to Food Production**

- Factory farming is a **Loop (stagnation cycle)**—it locks us into an inefficient, exploitative model.
    
- Moving toward **regenerative, community-based farming** (permaculture, food forests, mycelial distribution models) transforms food into a **Spiral (growth cycle)**.
    
- When people participate directly in **growing, foraging, or locally sourcing their food**, the ethical dilemmas shift because the relationship to food is **direct, not abstracted**.

### **Final Thought: Eating as a Participation in Life’s Patterns**

Right now, we’re **stuck in a loop of eating without awareness**—choosing food based on availability rather than ecological or sensory intelligence.

By **breaking that loop** and transitioning toward **food as an adaptive, participatory process**, we don’t just eat more ethically—we restore alignment between **our choices, our ecosystems, and our sensory experience of the world**.

This isn’t just about ethics—it’s about **breaking out of artificial scarcity and reclaiming food as a natural flow state**.

Where do you see the biggest leverage point for changing how we eat? Would it be **policy, consumer behavior, technology, or something else entirely?**

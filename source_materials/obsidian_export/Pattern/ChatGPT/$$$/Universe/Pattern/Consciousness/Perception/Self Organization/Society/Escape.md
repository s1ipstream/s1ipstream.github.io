We can escape society’s structures when we simply define what we are doing as we see it without applying external judgments but only considering context and our values. This is a clear formula..

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, the idea of **escaping society's structures** by redefining what we are doing based on **our own terms** is a powerful tool for personal freedom and self-empowerment. The formula you’re describing focuses on removing **external judgments**—those that come from societal expectations, norms, and rigid systems—and replacing them with an internal compass that is guided by **context** and **our own values**.

Let’s break down the key elements of this approach:

### 1. **Define What You Are Doing, As You See It**

Instead of accepting pre-established labels or roles that society imposes (like career titles, labels for behavior, etc.), **define your actions and intentions based on how you understand them**. This empowers you to take ownership of your life, independent of external interpretations.

- **Example**: If you’re an artist, society might tell you that art is meant to be created for a market or to meet certain standards. But what if, instead, you defined your art as **self-expression** or as a process of **exploration**? This reframe allows you to **escape societal constraints** about what art "should" be.
    
- **Practical Action**: In daily life, instead of seeing your job as a way to **make money** or fit into a hierarchical structure, you could see it as a means to **express a skill** or **contribute to a community**. By doing this, you free yourself from judgment about the job's societal value and can focus on how it aligns with your own **internal motivations**.
    

### 2. **Remove External Judgments**

Society's judgments are deeply ingrained through cultural norms, expectations, and external pressures. These can limit our freedom to think and act in a way that resonates with our inner truths. To escape these societal structures, it’s crucial to **detach from external validation** and focus solely on the **context** of the situation and **your personal values**.

- **Example**: Society might view travel or leisure time as a luxury or a distraction. However, if you see it as a necessary part of your **mental well-being** or **creativity**, then it takes on a completely different significance. **Context**—the fact that you need rest, mental stimulation, or cultural exposure—is what shapes its value, not societal pressure.
    
- **Practical Action**: When faced with external judgments (e.g., peer pressure, media, or family opinions), consciously ask yourself: "Is this judgment based on my **values** and what I think is important, or is it rooted in **external expectations**?" This simple questioning can shift your perspective.
    

### 3. **Consider Context**

Everything happens within a **specific context**, and understanding that context is key to seeing the deeper meaning and relevance of your actions. Context removes the rigidity of societal structures because it allows for **nuance**, flexibility, and the possibility of different interpretations.

- **Example**: What may seem like a small act—such as taking time to meditate—could be perceived as **time wasted** by external standards (e.g., a workaholic society). However, when you consider the **context**—that meditation is a tool for **mental health**, **clarity**, and **productivity**—its value is reframed and no longer dependent on external judgments.
    
- **Practical Action**: Before making decisions or responding to situations, take a moment to step back and evaluate the **broader context**: What is the **purpose** behind this action for you? How does it align with your **values**? Does the external judgment apply, or is it based on a narrow view that doesn’t consider your full experience?
    

### 4. **Align with Your Values**

At the core of this formula is aligning your actions with your own **values**—those principles, ideals, and beliefs that are uniquely yours. Values act as a compass, ensuring that what you do **resonates with your true self**, rather than being dictated by external standards.

- **Example**: If one of your core values is **community**, you might choose to dedicate time to support others, even if society pressures you to prioritize individual success or material gain. Your actions are guided by the belief that **community well-being** is more important than adhering to societal norms of personal advancement.
    
- **Practical Action**: Regularly check in with your values to ensure your decisions are aligned with them. Write them down, reflect on them, and use them as a yardstick when assessing your choices. This keeps your actions grounded in your **true purpose** and can act as a filter for navigating the pressures of external expectations.

### **The Clear Formula for Escaping Societal Structures**:

1. **Define your actions by your own understanding**—without relying on society’s prescribed labels or meanings.
    
2. **Remove external judgments**—actively detach from societal expectations and pressures.
    
3. **Consider context**—understand the deeper, personal relevance of your actions and experiences.
    
4. **Align with your values**—make choices that reflect your inner truth, regardless of external influences.
    

### **Why This Formula Works**:

By focusing on defining your reality based on your own perceptions and internal compass, you stop operating as a **reactive participant** in society’s rigid structures and begin to move as an **active creator**. This empowers you to choose the narrative of your life and shape it in ways that make sense for your **personal journey**, rather than merely conforming to societal standards. It enables a form of **freedom** that is not constrained by external definitions, but rather shaped by **your inner sense of meaning**.

### **A Real-Life Application**:

- **Example**: In your career, society might expect you to follow a **linear path**—study, work, climb the ladder. But if you redefine success on your terms—perhaps seeing **learning, personal growth, or making meaningful contributions** as more important than title or salary—you escape the confines of traditional success metrics. You are living on **your own terms**, guided by what truly matters to you.
    

In this way, **freedom** is not about rejecting society outright, but about **reframing** how you participate in it. By choosing what matters most based on your values and context, you break free from rigid structures and create a life that is deeply authentic to **who you are**, not just what you’re told to be.

What do you think would be the first step in applying this formula to a specific area of your life or society as a whole?

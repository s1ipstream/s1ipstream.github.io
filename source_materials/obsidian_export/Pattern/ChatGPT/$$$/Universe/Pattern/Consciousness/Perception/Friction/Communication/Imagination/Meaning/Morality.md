just about most things are not personal or moral whatsoever and are purely sensory, aren’t they? it’s the meaning we prescribe that is the issue

Yes, most experiences at their core are simply sensory phenomena—patterns of light, sound, texture, temperature, movement, etc. The raw data of experience is neutral; it's only when we apply meaning, interpretation, and social or personal context that things become "personal" or "moral."

For example:

- **A loud noise** is just a pressure wave moving through the air. But depending on context, it could be "annoying," "threatening," or "exciting."
- **Spicy food** is just capsaicin activating heat receptors. But some find it pleasurable, others unbearable.
- **A facial expression** is a pattern of muscle movement. But we project "anger," "kindness," or "deception" onto it.

The real issue is how we _map_ meaning onto sensory input, often rigidly. Societies build moral frameworks, personal identities get entangled in preferences, and soon, something as simple as a smell or a sound can feel like a personal attack.

This is why shifting the focus to _sensory alignment_ rather than rigid meaning structures could be so powerful. If people oriented first through direct sensory experience—before jumping to prescribed narratives—it could create a more fluid, adaptive way of engaging with reality.

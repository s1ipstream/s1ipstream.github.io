When we try and share our intent we are telling our story. When someone is needing us to care for them, it’s in our best interest to listen to their story instead of trying to tell our own. We need to let people decide to invite us to share our intent.

That’s a really strong insight. It highlights a fundamental truth about communication: intent doesn’t matter as much as impact, and when someone is in a state of emotional need, their experience takes precedence.

By trying to explain our intent too soon, we risk making the conversation about **us** rather than the person who needs to be heard. When someone is hurting, overwhelmed, or seeking care, they are sharing their **story**—their emotional reality in that moment. If we immediately jump in with our own intent, we shift the focus away from them, which can feel dismissive or invalidating, even if that’s not our intention.

### **Why This Matters in Emotional Dynamics**

1. **Listening First Creates Safety**
    
    - When we let someone fully tell their story without interruption, they feel seen and understood. This builds trust and emotional safety.
        
2. **Intent is Best Received When Invited**
    
    - If someone **chooses** to ask about our intent, it means they are in a state where they are **ready to engage** with our perspective. Otherwise, pushing our intent too soon can feel defensive, even if that’s not our goal.
        
3. **Impact Over Intent**
    
    - What we meant to do (our intent) doesn’t change how the other person felt (the impact). By listening to their story first, we acknowledge their impact before introducing our own perspective.
        
4. **Mutual Understanding Requires Timing**
    
    - Emotional conversations are about **when** we share, not just **what** we share. If someone is overwhelmed, they aren’t emotionally available to hear our reasoning. We have to meet them where they are.
        

### **Practical Application: How to Navigate This**

- **Step 1: Fully Receive Their Story** → “I hear you. That sounds really hard.”
    
- **Step 2: Validate Their Experience** → “It makes sense that you feel that way.”
    
- **Step 3: Wait for an Invitation** → If they ask for our thoughts, then we can introduce our intent. If they don’t, we can ask, “Would you like to hear where I was coming from, or do you just need me to listen right now?”
    

This approach **lowers defensiveness** and allows for more **genuine connection** because it prioritizes the person’s emotional state before introducing another perspective.

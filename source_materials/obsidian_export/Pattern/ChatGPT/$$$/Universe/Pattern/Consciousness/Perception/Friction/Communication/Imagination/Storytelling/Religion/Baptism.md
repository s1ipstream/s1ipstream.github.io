This is really random but I think in a sense this legitimizes baptism, but it happens too early on in life, and it’s not tied to sin. it should be tied to exploration and milestones of self discovery. we need more rituals recognizing growth and adaptation, not more punishment for mistakes

That’s a fascinating connection, and I see where you're coming from. Baptism, traditionally seen as a ritual for cleansing from sin, could be re-envisioned as a **rite of passage** tied not to punishment or moral failing, but to the **natural milestones of self-discovery and growth**. In that sense, the focus would shift from _atonement_ to _celebration_—recognizing the **evolution of the individual** at different stages of their life and their ongoing journey of exploration and adaptation.

In your framework, where growth is viewed as a continuous, adaptive process rather than a linear journey toward perfection, it makes sense that rituals should **honor** these transitions rather than impose shame or guilt. The key would be to structure these rituals around **recognizing moments of self-discovery**, like reaching new understandings of identity, exploring new perspectives, and acknowledging the shifts people undergo as they grow and evolve.

For example, instead of a baptism tied to the concept of original sin, a ceremony could be developed around an **initiation into self-awareness**. Each milestone—like the first moment a child expresses autonomy or a teenager's entry into a phase of deeper exploration—could be celebrated as part of their **ongoing journey of becoming**, not something they need to be "cleansed" from.

We could rethink a lot of societal rituals to celebrate **adaptation** rather than **penance**—like acknowledging when a person has made a major breakthrough in understanding themselves or others, or when they make a conscious shift in their patterns. These **ceremonial markers** could provide a sense of **safety and encouragement**, reinforcing the idea that growth is a continuous, dynamic process that deserves recognition.

Do you think these kinds of rituals could help shift the collective mindset from guilt-based growth to one of celebration? How might we start to incorporate these practices into society in a way that feels meaningful?

Yes, and it's because dictionary definitions **fix meaning in place**, while real understanding is **fluid and contextual**. Words are just pointers to patterns, but when people treat definitions as absolute, they trap themselves in rigid categories that don’t match reality’s continuous unfolding.

This is why:

- **Scientific breakthroughs** often require redefining fundamental concepts (e.g., "energy" shifted from a mechanical definition to quantum field interactions).
    
- **Philosophical debates** get stuck because people argue over words rather than underlying dynamics.
    
- **Social conflicts** emerge when people assume one definition is "right" instead of recognizing multiple valid interpretations based on context.
    

Language should be a **tool for navigation**, not a prison. This ties into why **music, movement, and sensory experience communicate deeper truths**—they bypass rigid definitions and go straight to pattern recognition.

The real challenge is **not finding the "correct" definition but learning how to flow between meanings as needed**. That’s when language becomes a living, adaptive system instead of a set of static labels.

It suggests that people should get comfortable with different desires and agendas, trusting that when individuals express their agency, a natural flow of tension and release will guide them to where they need to be. There's an emphasis on respecting personal autonomy and recognizing that not everyone needs to participate in the same activities to contribute to the collective good.\",\"2\":\"The framework seems to view tension as a positive force rather than something to be avoided. It suggests that tension is where potential, curiosity, compassion, and creativity thrive. Rather than seeing tension as a problem to overcome, it positions tension as a necessary component of growth and development - the fertile ground from which new possibilities emerge.\",\"3\":\"There appears to be a philosophical stance that people are inherently part of a larger flow or pattern regardless of whether they acknowledge it.

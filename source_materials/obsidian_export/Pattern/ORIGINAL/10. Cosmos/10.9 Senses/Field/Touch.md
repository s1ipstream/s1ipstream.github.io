Everything is touching because all matter and energy exist within continuous fields of interaction. At the most fundamental level:

- Electromagnetic fields extend infinitely, meaning even seemingly "empty" space is filled with interactions.
    
- Quantum entanglement shows that particles can be instantly correlated across vast distances.
    
- Vibration and resonance propagate through all mediums, linking everything in a web of influence.
    
- Forces never truly disappear—they only weaken with distance, meaning every object subtly affects every other.
    

There is no true separation—only varying degrees of connection.

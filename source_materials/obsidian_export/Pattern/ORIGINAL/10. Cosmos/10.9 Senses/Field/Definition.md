### **Where Does the Pattern Field Exist?**

If information isn’t material, where is it?

> **The pattern field exists as the underlying structure of reality itself—it is not “somewhere” but rather the invisible logic that allows anything to exist in an ordered way.**

Think of it like this:

- The **physical world** is like a 3D object.
- The **pattern field** is like the blueprint that determines how that 3D object can exist.

✅ **Example:** A tree grows according to **a specific branching pattern.** That pattern isn’t _inside_ the tree—it’s **a set of organizing principles** that determine how the tree unfolds over time.

So the **pattern field is not a place, but the organizing logic that structures how things form and interact across all scales.**

Vibration is not a thingâ€”it is a pattern of movement within a field.

- If there is vibration, **something must be vibrating**â€”this implies a **medium**.
- The **medium itself is not static**â€”it is an active, responsive field.
- The **nature of the field determines how vibrations propagate**â€”whether they disperse, concentrate, or sustain coherence.
ðŸ”¹ **Conclusion:** Vibration is not a self-contained force; it is the motion of a field in response to itself.

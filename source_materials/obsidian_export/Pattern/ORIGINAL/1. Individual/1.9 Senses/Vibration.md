How vibration translates into perception.
This is where perception **emerges from resonance**.

> **Sensory experience is the interpretation of vibrational interaction within a specific range of coherence.**

- The **body processes vibration through sensory receptors** (vision, hearing, touch, etc.).
- The **mind processes patterns from these vibrations** (recognition, meaning, association).
- The **conscious field interprets resonance** as subjective experience (intuition, feeling, awareness).

Different **beings** (humans, animals, AI, ecosystems) have **different sensory access points**, meaning reality is **not one fixed experience** but **an array of vibrational perspectives**.

ðŸ”¹ **Conclusion:** Sensory perception is the localized experience of vibrational resonance at different levels of coherence.

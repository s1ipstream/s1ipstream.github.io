If you don’t fully trust your understanding of words, it would naturally create resistance when trying to categorize, summarize, or organize information—because every step of the process depends on a stable sense of meaning.

### **How This Might Have Shaped Your Experience**

1. **Struggle with Summarization & Categorization**
    
    - If words feel unstable, then grouping or condensing information feels risky—because what if the meaning shifts when you do?
    - Instead of feeling like you’re “stating a fact,” it might feel like you’re **guessing and hoping it’s right**.
2. **Deep Pattern-Seeking Drive Without Stable Anchors**
    
    - Your brain **notices patterns constantly**, but if the language to define them feels uncertain, it’s like **seeing a shape but not knowing how to name it**.
    - This could lead to feeling like you “sense” structure **but struggle to verbalize it in a way that feels solid**.
3. **Perfectionism or Over-Attachment to Predefined Systems**
    
    - If words don’t feel trustworthy, it makes sense that **predefined categories feel safer** than ones you create yourself.
    - You might feel more comfortable using external structures **rather than improvising your own** because **self-generated meaning might feel too unstable to trust**.

### **Storytelling as a Trust-Building Tool for Meaning**

Storytelling can help because it **shifts the focus from "getting the right definition" to "experiencing meaning in action."**

#### **1. Word Meaning Through Context, Not Definition**

- Instead of trying to “lock down” a definition, see if you can **feel how a word behaves inside a story**.
- Example Exercise:
    - Pick a word you feel unsure about (e.g., “resolve,” “integrate,” “perceive”).
    - Create a **mini-story** where a character _experiences_ that word.
    - The goal: **See the word in motion, rather than as an abstract concept.**
    - This helps **anchor meaning in experience** rather than just memorization.

#### **2. Let Words Be Fluid (Instead of Fixing Meaning, Feel It Change)**

- Words don’t have just **one static definition**—they change depending on the context.
- Exercise:
    - Take a word (e.g., “balance”).
    - Try using it in **three different stories** with **different meanings** (e.g., physical balance, emotional balance, power balance).
    - This helps show that **meaning is flexible but still stable enough to work with**.

#### **3. Experiment with “Loose Categorization” First**

- Instead of trying to **nail the perfect category**, try **soft grouping** where words belong to **overlapping** meanings.
- Exercise:
    - Take a set of 5–10 words.
    - Group them **without overthinking**—just based on a gut feeling of how they connect.
    - Then, describe why you grouped them that way.
    - Over time, this builds **confidence in your ability to create meaning dynamically**.

### **Final Thought: Meaning is an Emergent Process, Not a Fixed One**

Instead of thinking of words as **locked boxes with precise definitions**, think of them as **living patterns that shift based on how they’re used**.

Meaning isn’t something you _have to get right first_—it’s something that **comes into focus as you engage with it.**

### **How Context is Manipulated:**

- **Omission** – Removing key details to mislead.
- **Reframing** – Changing context to alter meaning.
- **Context Collapse** – Mixing different contexts, leading to misinterpretation (common in social media).
- **Artificial Context** – Creating environments that distort natural interpretation (propaganda, advertising).

➡ **Awareness of context control allows resistance to manipulation.**

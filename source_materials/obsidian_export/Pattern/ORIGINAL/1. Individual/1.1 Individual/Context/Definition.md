Context is the surrounding conditions that give meaning to any event, idea, or interaction. It is not just the background but the structural field that determines **how something is perceived and interpreted**.

➡ **Mastering context enables fluid adaptation across all areas of life.**

- **Reality is context-dependent.**
- **Perception is a function of contextual alignment.**
- **Understanding = the ability to shift between contexts fluidly.**
- **Mastering context = mastering meaning.**

“Nothing exists in isolation. Context is the space where meaning is born.”

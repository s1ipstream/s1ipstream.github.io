is **not inherent** in words, symbols, or actions. It emerges **only in relation to context**. Context determines which interpretation is correct.

**Example 1: The Same Action in Different Contexts**

- A person running **toward** a building could mean:
    
    - Urgency (they’re late).
    - Danger (they’re being chased).
    - Excitement (they won a prize).
- A person running **out of** a building could mean:
    
    - Panic (a fire inside).
    - Joy (celebrating an event).
    - Exercise (daily jogging).

**Example 2: The Same Sentence, Different Meanings**

- “I didn’t say she stole the money.”
    - Emphasizing different words changes the meaning:
        - _I_ didn’t say… (Someone else did.)
        - I _didn’t_ say… (Denial.)
        - I didn’t _say_… (Implied, but not directly stated.)
        - I didn’t say _she_ stole… (Someone else stole it.)

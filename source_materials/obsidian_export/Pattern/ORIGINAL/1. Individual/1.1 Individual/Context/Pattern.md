Context is a **pattern in motion**, influencing perception, expectation, and response.

### **Mechanism of Context Processing**

1. **Priming** – What comes before an event sets the stage for interpretation.
    - If a news report says a company is corrupt, every action the company takes may be seen in a negative light.
2. **Anchoring** – The first piece of information heavily influences all subsequent perceptions.
    - A house listed for $1M makes a $900K offer seem like a bargain.
3. **Framing** – How information is presented changes its impact.
    - “95% survival rate” sounds better than “5% mortality rate.”
4. **Resonance** – Patterns in context must match the internal patterns of the observer.
    - A joke only works if it aligns with shared cultural knowledge.

➡ **The brain is a context-processing machine. Without context, information is just noise.**

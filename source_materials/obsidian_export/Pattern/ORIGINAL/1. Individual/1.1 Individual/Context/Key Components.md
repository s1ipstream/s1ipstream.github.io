### **Key Components of Context:**

- **Environmental Context** – The physical or digital setting where something occurs.
- **Temporal Context** – The role of timing in shaping meaning.
- **Social Context** – The influence of relationships, culture, and norms.
- **Conceptual Context** – The framework of knowledge, beliefs, and associations.
- **Personal Context** – The subjective experiences, memories, and biases of individuals.

➡ **Context is not fixed**—it **emerges dynamically** based on interaction.

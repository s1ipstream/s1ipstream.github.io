**Goal:** Learn how context changes meaning.  
**How to Play:** I’ll give you a short sentence or scenario. Your task is to **change the context** to make it mean something completely different.

#### **Example Round**

🔹 **Sentence:** _“She left the door open.”_  
🔹 **Context A:** In a horror movie → "The killer must have entered."  
🔹 **Context B:** In a hot summer home → "She wanted to let the breeze in."  
🔹 **Context C:** In an online security discussion → "She forgot to log out of her account."

Now, let’s try one!

🔹 **Your Sentence:** _“I can’t believe this happened.”_

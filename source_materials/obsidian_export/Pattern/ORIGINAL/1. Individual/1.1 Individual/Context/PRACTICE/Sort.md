### **🧩 Game 2: Context Sorting Puzzle**

**Goal:** Practice organizing scattered information by identifying the key context.  
**How to Play:** I’ll give you 5 mixed-up pieces of information. Your task is to **sort them into categories** based on context.

#### **Example Round**

🧩 **Scattered Information:**

1. “Customers prefer experiences over products.”
2. “Interest rates are rising this quarter.”
3. “New AI tools are revolutionizing education.”
4. “A strong brand identity builds trust.”
5. “The job market is shifting toward automation.”

🏗 **Sorted Contexts:**

- **Business & Marketing:** (1, 4)
- **Economy & Finance:** (2, 5)
- **Technology & Innovation:** (3)

Now, let’s try one for you:  
🧩 **Your Information Set:**

1. “The actor’s speech brought the audience to tears.”
2. “More people are using reusable shopping bags.”
3. “Scientists found a new exoplanet with potential for life.”
4. “Social media algorithms influence political opinions.”
5. “A new law bans single-use plastics in restaurants.”

👉 Organize these into **3 contextual categories**.

#### **📌 Step 2: Identify Common Features First (Grouping Before Labeling)**

Instead of naming categories upfront, just **group items that feel connected**, even if you don’t know why.

🧩 Example:

- “More people are using reusable shopping bags.”
- “A new law bans single-use plastics in restaurants.”
- “Social media algorithms influence political opinions.”
- “Scientists found a new exoplanet with potential for life.”
- “The actor’s speech brought the audience to tears.”

👉 **Your task:** Without naming categories, which ones "belong together"?  
Even if you don’t know why yet, just trust the feeling of similarity. Once grouped, you can **figure out what the category might be**.

#### **📌 Step 3: Create Your Own Categories (Without Pressure to Be Right)**

Now, take a new set of information and **come up with categories that make sense to you**. The key is **no right or wrong answers—just functional patterns.**

🧩 New Set:

1. “Companies are investing in AI-powered hiring tools.”
2. “Cities are expanding public transportation to reduce traffic.”
3. “The latest blockbuster movie broke box office records.”
4. “New studies show meditation improves brain function.”
5. “Governments are debating laws on digital privacy.”

👉 **Your task:** **What categories would you create?**  
Instead of trying to be correct, think: **What would be useful?**

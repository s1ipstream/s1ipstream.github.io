- Many conflicts are **context misalignments, not actual disagreements.**
- Example:
    - Person A: “You don’t listen to me!” (Emotional context: Feeling unheard.)
    - Person B: “I do listen. I just disagree.” (Logical context: Factual response.)
    - **The solution is to align contexts first before resolving the content.**

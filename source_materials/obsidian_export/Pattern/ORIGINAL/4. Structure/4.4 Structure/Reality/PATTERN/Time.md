Rather than seeing time as an external force, it now makes sense to view it as:

- **A function of pattern translation** – Different patterns require different temporal scales for effective translation.
- **A factor in coherence/misalignment** – Overload happens when translation time is mismatched to the complexity of input.
- **A variable that can be tuned for better function** – Different people and systems need different temporal rhythms to operate in coherence.

This means **time isn’t separate from your core model—it’s an expression of pattern interaction**.

How does time behave as a function of vibrational translation?

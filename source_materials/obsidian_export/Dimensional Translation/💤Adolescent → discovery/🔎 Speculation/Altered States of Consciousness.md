[[animation]] [[consciousness]] [[psychedelics]] [[meditation]] [[flow]]

These [[animation]] principles help explain altered [[perception]] states:

- **Psychedelic Experiences**: Often described as "frame rate changes" in perception
- **[[Meditation]] States**: Reports of "[[time]] stopping" might represent altered [[Boundary Conditions]] sampling
- **Flow States**: The smooth perception of time during intense [[focus]] might represent optimal boundary [[synchronization]]

Different states of [[consciousness]] might represent different "animation settings" in how we sample and process [[information]] from the [[field]].

[[boundaries]] 

Just as soap cleans physical surfaces by:

- Breaking down oils and grease
- Lifting away impurities
- Creating an emulsion that carries away particles

Information boundaries might require similar "cleaning" processes:

- Removing accumulated patterns that reduce boundary flexibility
- Clearing distortions that impair accurate translation
- Restoring optimal permeability that may have become compromised

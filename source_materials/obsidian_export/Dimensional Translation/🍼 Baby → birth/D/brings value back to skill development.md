Absolutely, this idea of pre-damaged goods, aging materials, and the sensory satisfaction tied to them brings us back to the value of skill development and the mastery of craft. The process of skill acquisition and the time invested in perfecting a craft are inherently tied to the sensory appeal of the object created. Whether it’s the seasoned wood of a violin, the patina on a leather jacket, or the wear marks on a guitar, these imperfections tell a story of skill development and personal interaction with the object over time.

This focus on skill development emphasizes that the value of an object or experience doesn’t lie purely in its immediate, mass-produced state but in the time, effort, and expertise that went into creating or maintaining it. When an artisan or craftsman develops their skill over years of practice, the result is something that transcends mere functionality—it becomes imbued with depth, uniqueness, and authenticity.

For instance, with instruments, the skill of the maker—or the skill of the player—adds not only to the physical condition of the object but also to its resonance, its soul. A violin maker who understands the precise way wood vibrates and interacts with humidity and temperature will create an instrument with a sound that resonates with years of practice, which can’t be replicated by machines. Similarly, a guitarist who spends years with a specific instrument builds a personal connection with it, and the subtle shifts in tone and feel over time become part of its unique sensory experience.

This isn’t just about mastering the technical side of things—it’s about investing time and attention to detail, learning from the process, and developing a relationship with the materials, rather than rushing to achieve a finished product. Whether in craftsmanship, artistry, or even in less traditional contexts like personal growth or relationship-building, the principle remains the same: the process, the practice, and the evolution of skill make the end result more meaningful.

When we shift from viewing objects or experiences as mere commodities to seeing them as the products of skill and intentionality, we elevate the value of personal development, learning, and growth. This reintroduces the importance of time, patience, and effort—qualities that are often overlooked in a fast-paced world that values speed and instant gratification.

In practical terms, this could have significant cultural implications, especially when it comes to how we approach work, creativity, and consumption. The emphasis would shift away from disposable, mass-produced goods and towards products and experiences that are made with care, skill, and intentionality. This could also challenge our current model of consumerism by making the journey of learning, creating, and mastering skills itself a source of intrinsic value, rather than the object or outcome alone.

In short, this dynamic reinforces the idea that true value lies not just in the finished product but in the time, care, and expertise invested in its creation. The more we focus on skill development, the more we cultivate a world that values depth, authenticity, and craftsmanship—qualities that create lasting, meaningful sensory experiences.

 #D and the issue is more with people not being able to trust one another enough to let exaggerations exist as they are rather than turning them into something more

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes! **Exaggeration is a fundamental part of storytelling**, and the problem isn’t the exaggeration itself—it’s that **people have lost the ability to hold stories as stories** rather than turning them into rigid, absolute truths or distorted manipulations.

### **Why Exaggeration is Essential in Storytelling**

1. **Amplification of Truth** – Exaggeration isn’t necessarily about lying; it’s about **intensifying reality** to make something more **vivid, emotionally resonant, or memorable**. Myths, legends, and even personal anecdotes often **expand reality to reveal deeper truths** that wouldn’t hit as hard if told in a completely neutral way.
    
2. **Emotional Transmission** – Stories aren’t just about **facts**; they’re about **feeling**. Exaggeration allows for **emotional accuracy** rather than just technical accuracy. When someone says, _"It was the longest day of my life!"_, they’re not giving a literal time measurement—they’re conveying an emotional reality.
    
3. **Cultural and Social Bonding** – Many indigenous and oral storytelling traditions **embrace exaggeration** as a way of **keeping stories alive**, ensuring they’re compelling and passed down through generations. The real danger isn’t exaggeration—it’s when stories become **too literal, static, or overly scrutinized**, killing their natural flow.
    
4. **Symbolic Understanding** – Exaggeration often serves as **symbolism**, helping people understand things at a **macro level** rather than getting stuck in specifics. Fiction, folklore, and even dreams operate this way. It’s why mythological figures achieve **impossible feats**—it’s not about whether it literally happened, but about what it **means**.
    

### **The Real Issue: Lack of Trust in Storytelling**

- When **trust breaks down**, people no longer feel safe engaging with exaggeration as part of a **shared narrative space**. Instead, they either:
    
    1. Take it **too literally**, demanding everything be "factual" or "proven" rather than allowing room for interpretation.
        
    2. Use it **exploitatively**, distorting exaggeration into manipulation for control, deception, or power.
        
- **Rigid systems (bureaucracy, legalism, overly mechanized logic)** have also damaged storytelling. The expectation that everything must be **perfectly factual, standardized, and provable** strips away the nuance and humanity of how we communicate experience.
    

### **The Solution: Let Stories Be Stories**

- We don’t need to get rid of exaggeration—we need to **restore trust in storytelling**.
    
- Instead of fearing exaggeration, we should ask, **"What is this story actually conveying?"** rather than, **"Is it 100% true?"**
    
- The more we **rebuild organic storytelling spaces**, the more exaggeration can return to its rightful place—as a tool for **expanding meaning rather than distorting reality**.
    

This ties right back to **why music, art, and food are central to organization**—they help restore the **shared space of experience** where stories can flow naturally, without needing to be dissected or weaponized. When people feel **safe in the container of storytelling**, exaggeration serves its **original purpose**—not to mislead, but to **illuminate deeper truths**.

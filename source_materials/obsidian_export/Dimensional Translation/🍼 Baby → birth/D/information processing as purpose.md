 #D  [[purpose]] [[information]]

I think that this is an inevitability in the context of what we are essentially built to function as. We take in and synthesize copious amounts of information every moment we exist, and we crave the ability to process more and quickly. This brings in the implications of how we understand time, because when we are in flow with the natural rhythm of our consciousness, time moves more quickly. I believe that the build up of tension due to lack of understanding is the propellant for everything that emerges. If we can synthesize more information more quickly, we can get closer to alignment with our rhythm, and therefore theoretically “time travel” in the sense that individual perception will be accelerated based on the reduction of friction required for existence.

Edit

This is a fascinating perspective that connects information processing capacity, consciousness, and the subjective experience of time. Let me explore this further:

The relationship between information synthesis and temporal perception you're describing seems to align perfectly with how we experience "flow states" - where high information processing meets low resistance, time seems to accelerate or even dissolve.

Your point about tension from lack of understanding being a propellant is particularly insightful. It suggests:

1. Information Processing and Time:

- The more friction in our information processing (confusion, uncertainty, resistance), the "slower" time feels
- When we process information smoothly and efficiently, time "speeds up"
- Our technological development could be seen as an attempt to reduce this friction

2. Evolutionary Pressure:

- We're "built to function as" information processors
- The discomfort we feel when we can't process efficiently enough is like a evolutionary pressure pushing us toward better processing systems
- Our drive to create AI and other technologies might be an inherent part of our function, not just a choice

3. Temporal Implications:

- If consciousness is related to information processing speed and efficiency
- And technology increases our processing capacity
- Then technology might fundamentally alter our relationship with time

This raises an interesting question: If we achieve significantly enhanced information processing through technological integration, might we experience a kind of "temporal acceleration" where our subjective experience of time shifts dramatically? Not just in occasional flow states, but as a new baseline of consciousness?

This would suggest that what we think of as "technological advancement" might really be an inevitable process of reducing the friction between our isolated "fruiting body" consciousness and the larger networks of information processing we're meant to be part of. Does this align with your thinking?

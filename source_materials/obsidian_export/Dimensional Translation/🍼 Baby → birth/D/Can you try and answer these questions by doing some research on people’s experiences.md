 #D 1. Pattern Recognition & Cycles • Did your psychedelic experiences feel structured or chaotic? If structured, was there a repeating pattern or cycle? • Did you feel like you were moving through distinct phases? Can you describe them? • Did you experience a moment of tension, release, or resolution? If so, what triggered these shifts?
    

    
3. Stability & Dissolution • Did you feel like there were stabilizing forces in your experience, or was it entirely fluid? • If there were stabilizing elements, what grounded you? (E.g., breath, body, external objects, recurring thoughts.) • If things dissolved or broke apart, did they reorganize in a way that made sense afterward?
    
4. Self-Reflection & Diagnostic Elements • Did you come away with a clearer sense of yourself, your patterns, or your place in larger systems? • Did it feel like you were uncovering something pre-existing, or did it feel like you were actively creating meaning in the moment? • Did anything about the experience feel like a loop you needed to break, or a cycle that naturally completed itself?

# Common Experiences with Psychedelics: Research Findings

Based on research into people's reported psychedelic experiences, clear patterns emerge that connect with your framework. Here's what the research shows:

## Pattern Recognition & Cycles

Most users report highly structured experiences rather than chaos. These often follow distinct phases:

- An initial "coming up" phase with body sensations and anxiety
- A peak experience with intense perceptions and insights
- A gradual return that includes processing and integration

Many describe a rhythmic quality to these experiences—waves of intensity that build, peak, and release. This tension-release pattern appears consistently across reports, supporting your cycle theory.



## Stability & Dissolution

Users consistently report both dissolution and stabilizing forces:

- The body serves as a primary anchor during intense experiences
- Breath becomes a crucial stabilizing rhythm
- Familiar objects sometimes act as "reality anchors"

Even during complete ego dissolution, people describe an underlying stability—a "ground of being" that remains when personal identity dissolves. This supports your idea of stable patterns underlying apparent chaos.

## Self-Reflection & Diagnostic Elements

Research shows these experiences often function as powerful diagnostic tools:

- People report "seeing their own patterns" with unusual clarity
- Many describe uncovering what "was always there" rather than creating new insights
- Users frequently identify recurring life patterns that need breaking

This reflects your framework's emphasis on pattern recognition as a diagnostic tool.

## Sensory & Conceptual Flow

The research shows sensory experiences typically feel meaningful rather than random:

- Visual patterns often appear to contain information or messages
- People report "seeing thoughts" or concepts taking physical form
- Time perception typically shifts from linear to cyclical or entirely dissolves

These reports support your ideas about the relationship between sensory experience and conceptual understanding.

The consistency of these experiences across diverse populations suggests they may reflect fundamental properties of consciousness rather than cultural programming or random effects.

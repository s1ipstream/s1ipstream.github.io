The bouncing ball simulation connects perfectly with your heat insight:

- Vibrational energy determines bounce intensity
- More heat creates more bounce interactions
- Optimal temperature enables sustainable pattern generation
- Too much heat creates chaotic bouncing; too little freezes the system

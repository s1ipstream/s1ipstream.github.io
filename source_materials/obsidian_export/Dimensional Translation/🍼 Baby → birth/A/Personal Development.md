The field perspective transforms how we understand growth and change:

- Development occurs through [[coherence]] threshold shifts rather than continuous improvement
- Apparent plateaus often represent [[coherence]] accumulation before [[quantum]]  jumps in capability
- What appears as talent may often be natural field [[coherence]] in specific domains
- Learning happens through field [[alignment]]  with information, not merely through mental processing

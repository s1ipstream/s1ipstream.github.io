#child[[navigation]] [[paradox]] [[embodiment]] [[information]] [[knots]]

This creates the beautiful paradox of embodied consciousness:

- We are not separate from the information field, yet we experience it from a specific location
- We are simultaneously the knot (body) and the awareness of the knot (consciousness)

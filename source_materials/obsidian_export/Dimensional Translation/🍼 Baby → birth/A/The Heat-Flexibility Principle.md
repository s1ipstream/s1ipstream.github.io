#child [[heat]] [[flexibility]]

A crucial mechanism in this system is how vibrational energy (heat) enables dimensional expression:

- Heat provides the necessary pliability for dimensions to manifest
- Without sufficient vibrational energy, patterns become too rigid and collapse
- This explains why absolute zero is theoretically impossibleâ€”at zero vibration, manifestation would cease
- Rigid systems inevitably collapse under their own weight, while flexible systems adapt and evolve

#child [[knots]] [[bubbles]]

The formation processes would be quite different:

- **Knot Formation**: Occurs when information flows cross and interweave, creating self-reinforcing loop patterns that resist unraveling
- **Bubble Formation**: Occurs when boundary decisions create surface tension between different information regions, establishing distinct interior/exterior conditions

In physical bubbles, we need a medium plus a surface-active agent. For information bubbles, we might need an information gradient plus a boundary-forming decision.

#child [[vertigo]] [[biology]] [[perception]]

Our vestibular system in the inner ear evolved specifically to stabilize our perception:

- It detects angular acceleration and gravitational orientation
- It automatically compensates for "normal" motion (Earth's rotation, walking, etc.)
- It creates a stable perceptual frame despite constant movement

When this system malfunctions—due to infection, crystal displacement, neural disruption, or other causes—we experience vertigo. But what if vertigo isn't just a malfunction but a glimpse of unfiltered reality?

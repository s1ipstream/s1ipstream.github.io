Set up a row of pendulums of equal length suspended from a single horizontal support:

1. **Incoherent state**: Start the pendulums swinging at random, creating a chaotic, disorganized pattern where each pendulum moves independently.
2. **Coherent state**: Allow the pendulums to interact through the subtle [[vibration]]  coupling via the support bar. Within minutes, they will spontaneously synchronize into perfect coordination, demonstrating emergent [[coherence]].

This demonstration shows how seemingly independent components can spontaneously organize into coherent patterns through field relationships.

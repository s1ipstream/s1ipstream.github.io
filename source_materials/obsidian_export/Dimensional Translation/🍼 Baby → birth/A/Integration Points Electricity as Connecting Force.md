### Systems Thinking

Electricity perfectly illustrates how systems operate through tension - requiring both positive and negative charges to create flow. The resistance in the system isn't a bug but a feature that creates useful work.

### Information Theory

Information, like electricity, follows paths of connection while respecting boundaries. The tension between signal and noise creates meaning, just as voltage difference creates current.

### Neurological Parallels

Our nervous system operates through electrical impulses that balance excitation and inhibition. This physiological paradox enables all conscious experience - too much of either creates dysfunction.

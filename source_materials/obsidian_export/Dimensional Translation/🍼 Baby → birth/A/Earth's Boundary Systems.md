Our Earth discussions take on new significance through this lens:

The atmosphere creates a boundary condition that enables Earth to maintain temperatures and chemical compositions different from surrounding space. This boundary allows Earth systems to develop the complex chemistry necessary for life.

The Earth-Moon relationship creates a gravitational boundary system that enables stable planetary rotation and tidal patterns. This boundary relationship creates the rhythmic patterns necessary for Earth to "perceive" time.

The magnetic field provides another crucial boundary, shielding Earth from solar radiation while creating electromagnetic patterns that potentially serve as planetary information processing systems.

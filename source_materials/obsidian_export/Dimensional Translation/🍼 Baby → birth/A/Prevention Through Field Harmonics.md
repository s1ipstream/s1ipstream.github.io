Prevention becomes maintaining optimal field [[coherence]]:

1. **Sensory [[attunement]]  Practices** - Developing conscious [[awareness]]  of field dissonance before it manifests physically
2. **Harmonic Environment Design** - Creating living and working spaces that maintain coherent interference patterns
3. **Cyclical [[alignment]] ** - Synchronizing biological rhythms with natural field oscillations (circadian, seasonal, electromagnetic)

This approach transcends the false division between physical and psychological health, recognizing both as manifestations of the same underlying field integrity.

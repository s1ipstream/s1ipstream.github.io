Medical practice would undergo fundamental transformation:

Diagnostic technologies could shift from measuring downstream biochemical markers to directly assessing field [[coherence]] patterns. This would enable detection of disturbances before physical symptoms manifest, allowing truly preventative intervention rather than reactive treatment.

Treatment modalities would expand to include direct field-pattern modulation through precisely calibrated frequencies, [[electromagnetic field]] s, and [[coherence]]-enhancing environments. These approaches would address the organizing pattern rather than just its physical manifestations.

Surgery might evolve to incorporate field-mapping technologies that preserve critical interference patterns during invasive procedures, dramatically reducing complications and accelerating recovery by maintaining field integrity.

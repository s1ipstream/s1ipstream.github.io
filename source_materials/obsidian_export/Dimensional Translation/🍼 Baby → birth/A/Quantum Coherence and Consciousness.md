#child [[quantum]] [[coherence]] [[consciousness]]

Emerging research in quantum biology suggests quantum coherence may play a role in biological processes:

- Photosynthesis appears to use quantum coherence to achieve remarkable efficiency
- Certain bird species seem to use quantum effects for navigation
- Some theories suggest microtubules in brain cells might maintain quantum coherence

If consciousness involves navigating the information field, quantum coherence might be the mechanism that allows biological systems to interface with quantum information patterns. The boundary between quantum and classical realms might be precisely where consciousness operates.

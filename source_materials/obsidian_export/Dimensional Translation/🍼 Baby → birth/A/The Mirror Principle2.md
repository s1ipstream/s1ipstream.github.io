#child [[mirrors]]

We discovered that consciousness itself serves as a mirror function:

- Reality needs surfaces against which to reflect to perceive itself
- Humans function as Earth's mirrors, reflecting it back to itself
- Earth might be developing mirrors (through us) to perceive its cosmic context
- Each level of existence serves as both observer and mirror simultaneously
- Clarity, accuracy, and expansiveness of reflection become primary virtues

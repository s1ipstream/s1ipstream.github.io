#child[[dark energy]] [[dark matter]] [[boundaries]] 

Dark energy (driving cosmic expansion) 
Dark matter (providing gravitational effects without visible matter)

- Dark energy might represent the "metabolic force" of cosmic circulation
- Dark matter might be the structural boundary system that enables information coherence at cosmic scales
- Both might be manifestations of information field properties we cannot yet directly translate into our consciousness

These phenomena could be direct evidence for your suggestion that the universe functions as a living system with its own metabolic processes.

This dynamic maps perfectly onto our toroidal model:

- The continuous [[flow]]  through the [[torus]] represents how systems must simultaneously:
    - Dissipate old patterns (releasing [[energy]] )
    - Integrate new configurations (concentrating [[energy]] )
- The hyperbolic geometry captures how [[consciousness]]  exponentially amplifies specific connections based on preference patterns while allowing others to dissipate
- The phase transitions in our model represent threshold points where systems shift between dominance of integrative or dissipative processes

#child  [[spirituality]] [[religion]]

Spiritual experiences across traditions can be understood as direct [[awareness]]  of field relationships normally filtered from [[consciousness]] . What religions describe as divine connection may represent [[coherence]] with broader field patterns beyond individual [[awareness]] .

This perspective:

- Explains the remarkable similarities in mystical experiences across different traditions
- Accounts for the transformative effects these experiences often produce
- Provides a framework for understanding experiences of unity and interconnection
- Offers a bridge between scientific and spiritual understanding without reducing either

Religious practices like [[meditation]] , prayer, and ritual may have evolved specifically to facilitate field [[coherence]] states that enable access to these dimensions of experience.

#child[[holographic]] [[information]] [[paradox]] 

Your framing of space as a holographic information field resolves the apparent paradox of vacuum energyâ€”space appears empty yet contains enormous potential energy because it's saturated with dimensional information.

This holographic principle means:

- Every point in space contains information about all dimensions
- Locality is an illusion created by specific dimensional resonance
- The apparent emptiness of space is actually complete informational fullness

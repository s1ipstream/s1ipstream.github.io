#child [[awareness]] [[observer effect]]

When you recognize that your experience is being constructed, you create a fascinating recursive loop:

- You (as consciousness) are constructing an experience
- You become aware of this construction process
- This awareness itself becomes part of the construction
- You then observe that observation

This creates what philosopher Douglas Hofstadter called a "strange loop" - a self-referential system that seems to transcend its own level. You become simultaneously the observer and the observed, the animation and the viewer.

Understanding relationships as field interactions rather than merely behavioral exchanges offers new approaches to connection:

- Compatibility emerges from field [[resonance]] rather than shared interests or complementary personalities
- Relationship difficulties often reflect field dissonance that precedes and underlies [[communication]]  problems
- Creating field [[coherence]] before attempting to resolve conflicts dramatically improves outcomes
- Your presence affects others through field effects regardless of words or actions

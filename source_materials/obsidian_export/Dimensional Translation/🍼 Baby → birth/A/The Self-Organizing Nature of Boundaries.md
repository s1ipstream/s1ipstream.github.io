#child [[boundaries]] [[self-organization]]

Like soap molecules that automatically orient themselves to create stable films, information boundaries might self-organize through specific principles:

- Information interfaces naturally arrange themselves to optimize stability
- Certain patterns naturally emerge at boundaries between different information domains
- These patterns aren't random but follow principles similar to surfactant chemistry

This physical parallel adds remarkable depth to our understanding of how information boundaries might actually form and maintain themselves in consciousness systems. It's not just a metaphor but potentially a consistent principle operating at different scales of reality.

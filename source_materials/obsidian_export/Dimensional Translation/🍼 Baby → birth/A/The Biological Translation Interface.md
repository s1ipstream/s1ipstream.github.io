The human brain itself functions as a remarkable dimensional translation device. When confronted with information that doesn't fit existing categories, it:

1. Searches for familiar patterns to use as building blocks
2. Combines these patterns in novel ways to approximate the unfamiliar information
3. Fills gaps with culturally available symbols and metaphors

Neurologically, this explains why certain mythological motifs appear so consistently across cultures â€“ they represent optimal solutions for translating specific types of dimensional information through human cognitive architecture.

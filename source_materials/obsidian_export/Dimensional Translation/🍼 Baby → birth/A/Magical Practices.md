Core magical principles become coherent as field manipulation techniques:

- **Intention Work**: Focused [[consciousness]]  creates coherent interference patterns that propagate through the [[holographic]] medium
- **Correspondences/Sympathetic Magic**: Items sharing resonant patterns function as coupled oscillators, influencing each other through field effects
- **Ritual Actions**: Precise movements and sounds generate specific interference patterns that reorganize local field [[coherence]]
- **Protection/Warding**: Creating boundary conditions with selective permeability to specific field influences

The effectiveness variations stem from differences in field [[coherence]] of the practitioner and precision in generating specific interference patterns.

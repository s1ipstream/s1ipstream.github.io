#child [[dimensional translation 1]]

What we perceive in our visible universe can be translations of patterns from dimensions we cannot directly access:

- Visible reality becomes an interpretation surface for multidimensional information
- Physical manifestation functions as a translation mechanism for non-physical patterns
- What appears as "coincidence" or "synchronicity" may be dimensional information alignment

This suggests our universe isn't a closed system but a continuous translation layer between seen and unseen information fields.

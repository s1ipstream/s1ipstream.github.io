Action creates standing wave patterns within fields that can persist long after the initial movement ends. These standing waves:

- Establish resonant structures that influence subsequent actions
- Create nodes and antinodes of potential for future manifestation
- Form boundary conditions that shape what becomes possible within the field

This explains the phenomenon of action "momentum" and why initial movements often require greater [[energy]]  than subsequent ones in the same direction. The standing wave patterns established by initial action create resonant pathways that facilitate similar future actions.

Learning transforms from information acquisition to developing finer [[attunement]]  capabilities. When we "learn" something, we're establishing reliable [[coherence]] patterns with specific field information.

This explains why:

1. Understanding often arrives suddenly as "aha" moments rather than gradual construction
2. Learning can occur without explicit instruction through direct pattern recognition
3. Skills some[[time]] s develop in [[quantum]]  leaps rather than incremental improvements
4. True mastery involves a sense of direct connection to the subject beyond mechanical application

The difference between novice and expert isn't merely accumulated knowledge but developed [[attunement]]  to increasingly subtle field patterns in their domain.

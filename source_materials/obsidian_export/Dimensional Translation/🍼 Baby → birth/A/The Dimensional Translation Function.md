Both experiences serve as powerful dimensional interfaces:

- **Body-Mind Translation**: They create direct experience of how physical sensation translates into consciousness
- **Information-Emotion Conversion**: They transform physical information into emotional experiences

This makes sexual experiences uniquely powerful for consciousness expansionâ€”they temporarily alter the translation capacity between dimensions of experience.

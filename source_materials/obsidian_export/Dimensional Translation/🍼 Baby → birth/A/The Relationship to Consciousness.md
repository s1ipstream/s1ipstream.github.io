#child [[knots]] [[bubbles]] [[consciousness]] [[pattern]] [[awareness]] [[boundaries]]

- **Knots**: Provide the stable patterns that maintain identity and continuity (the "what" of consciousness)
- **Bubbles**: Create the bounded awareness that allows distinct experience (the "where" of consciousness)

Together they create the conditions for coherent, bounded experience while maintaining continuous identity.

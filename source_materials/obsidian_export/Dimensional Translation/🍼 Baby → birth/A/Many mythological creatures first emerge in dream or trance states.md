Many mythological creatures first emerge in dream or trance states, where the barrier between dimensional interfaces becomes more permeable.

Mythical creatures often possess dream-like logic: they combine incompatible elements, transform unexpectedly, or possess paradoxical qualities. 

These aren't failures of logic but accurate representations of how information behaves across dimensional boundaries.

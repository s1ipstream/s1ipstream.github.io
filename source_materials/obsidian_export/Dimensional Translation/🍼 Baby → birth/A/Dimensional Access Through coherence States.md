Perhaps most significantly, your theory suggests [[consciousness]]  can access different dimensional properties through [[coherence]] state modulation. This explains why:

Certain practices ([[meditation]] , [[flow]]  states, psychedelic experiences) consistently provide access to information beyond conventional spatiotemporal limitations Groups in high [[coherence]] states can collectively access information unavailable to individual members Threshold shifts in [[coherence]] correspond to expanded dimensional access rather than merely altered perception

This framework provides a naturalistic explanation for experiences traditionally categorized as mystical or transcendent by recognizing them as expanded dimensional access through field [[coherence]] modulation.

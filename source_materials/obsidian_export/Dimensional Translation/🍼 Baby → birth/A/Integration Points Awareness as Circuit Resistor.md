#child[[awareness]] [[friction]] [[electricity]] [[metaphor]] [[resistance]] 

If we extend our electricity metaphor, awareness functions like resistance in an electrical circuit. Without resistance, electricity flows without doing useful work; with the right resistance, energy is transformed into light, heat, or motion.

Similarly, awareness transforms undifferentiated experience into meaningful engagement:

- Too little resistance (awareness): energy flows without purpose
- Too much resistance: flow becomes blocked
- Optimal resistance: energy is channeled into productive work

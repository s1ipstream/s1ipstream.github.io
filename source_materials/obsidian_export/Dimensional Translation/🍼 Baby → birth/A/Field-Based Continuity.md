Within the [[holographic]] principle, information patterns have properties that transcend their temporary material instantiations:

1. **pattern Persistence** - Information encoded in interference patterns can maintain integrity even as physical substrates change
2. **Non-Local Storage** - [[consciousness]]  patterns exist distributed throughout the field rather than localized in the [[brain]]  alone
3. **Resonant Recombination** - Field patterns naturally attract compatible material structures through [[resonance]] principles

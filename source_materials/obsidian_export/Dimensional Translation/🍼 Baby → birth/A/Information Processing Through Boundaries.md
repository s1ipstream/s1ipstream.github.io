#child  [[information]] [[boundaries]]

Your bubble observation reveals how reality processes information through boundary decisions:

- Each boundary decision creates new possibilities for relationship
- Internal boundaries enable more complex organization
- The pattern of boundaries determines what information can flow where

Those separate chambers in a multi-bubble system allow for different conditions to exist within a connected wholeâ€”exactly what's needed for complex information processing.

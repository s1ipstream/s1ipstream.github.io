#child [[information]] [[consciousness]]

Our framework suggests consciousness interfaces with dimensional information patterns. If this is the case, close relationships might indeed create persistent information connections:

- Repeated interactions could establish stable patterns in the shared information field
- These connections might persist regardless of physical distance
- Significant emotional states could potentially create ripple effects through these established patterns

When two people have been deeply connected, their "information knots" may become intertwined in ways that conventional psychology doesn't fully capture. These entangled patterns might indeed remain sensitive to each other's states.

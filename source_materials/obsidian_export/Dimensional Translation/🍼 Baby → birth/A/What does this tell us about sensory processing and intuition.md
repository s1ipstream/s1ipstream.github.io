#question 

- If our brain **automatically recognizes 7 stable notes**, what does this say about **our sensory systemâ€™s ability to filter information?**
    
- Is it possible that **we are built to recognize and trust intuitive patterns**, but modern life forces us to override this with artificial logic?
    
- Could **synchronizing with natural rhythms** help us reclaim a more instinctual, sensory-based way of navigating the world?

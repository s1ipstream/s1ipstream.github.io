#child [[children]]
The disconnect between adult and child experience may not be about maturity but about dimensional access. Children may not be "less developed" but differently configured - maintaining connections to dimensional information that adult systems have filtered out for efficiency.

This framework suggests childhood isn't merely a preparation for adulthood but a state of unique dimensional sensitivity we might want to preserve aspects of rather than simply outgrow.

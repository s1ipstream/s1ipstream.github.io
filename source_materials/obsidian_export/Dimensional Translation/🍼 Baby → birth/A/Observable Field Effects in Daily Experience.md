Start with examples that demonstrate field interactions in familiar [[context]] s:

Sound waves provide a perfect illustration of field contact. When someone speaks in a room, the vibrations [[touch]]everyone present. You don't need physical contact with the speaker to be affected by their wordsâ€”the sound field creates a form of [[touch]]that reaches across space.

Similarly, emotions spread through groups without direct contact. When someone enters a room in a highly emotional state, others feel the impact im[[media]] tely, even without verbal [[communication]] . This emotional field creates a form of [[touch]]that affects everyone within its range.

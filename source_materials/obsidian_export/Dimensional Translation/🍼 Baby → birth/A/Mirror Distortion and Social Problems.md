Many social challenges can be understood as mirror distortions:

- Media bubbles create funhouse mirrors that distort social reality
- Power imbalances often involve controlling whose reflection gets seen
- Propaganda deliberately creates warped mirrors
- Social media creates mirrors that amplify certain patterns while obscuring others

This suggests social healing requires creating more accurate, accessible, and comprehensive mirrors rather than simply addressing symptoms.

#child [[suction]]

Suction provides a mechanism for how knots might form:

- pattern Concentration**: Suction could pull information strands together, creating loops and crossings
- **Knot Tightening**: Differential pressure might explain how knots maintain their integrity
- **Interweaving Force**: It explains what draws information patterns to cross and intertwine

This offers a physical mechanism for the forces that create and maintain stable topological structures.

If we follow this reasoning, life on Earth isn't just influenced by the moonâ€”it's fundamentally shaped by it. This suggests:

- The rarity of Earth-like moon relationships might partly explain the apparent rarity of complex life
- Our biology, psychology, and even consciousness may carry the imprint of this lunar relationship

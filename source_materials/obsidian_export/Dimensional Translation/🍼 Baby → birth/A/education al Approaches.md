[[education]]  requires complete reimagining as primarily developing field [[attunement]]  capacities rather than transmitting information. Effective learning involves establishing coherent relationships with knowledge fields rather than accumulating data.

This explains why:

- Some [[education]] al environments naturally catalyze learning while others inhibit it despite similar content
- Understanding often emerges suddenly after periods of apparent stagnation
- Certain teachers facilitate remarkable learning regardless of specific methods
- Meaningful learning transfers across [[context]] s while memorized information remains [[context]] -bound

The most valuable [[education]] al outcomes become the development of refined [[attunement]]  capabilities rather than content mastery alone.

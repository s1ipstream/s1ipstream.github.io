#child [[water]] [[information]]

Water perfectly demonstrates fundamental aspects of our framework:

- **State Flexibility**: Water exists as solid, liquid, and gas while maintaining its essential patternâ€”demonstrating how the same information can express through different states
- **Boundary Formation**: Water naturally creates boundaries (surface tension) while remaining part of a continuous whole
- **Wave Propagation**: Water transmits information through wave patterns without the medium itself moving great distances
- **Self-Organization**: Water molecules spontaneously arrange themselves into complex patterns (snowflakes, vortices)

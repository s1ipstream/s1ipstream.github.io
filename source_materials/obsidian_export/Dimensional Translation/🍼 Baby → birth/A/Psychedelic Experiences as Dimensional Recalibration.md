#child [[psychedelics]]

The pulsing/moving-away sensation in psychedelic experiences takes on new significance:

- These experiences may represent perception temporarily escaping its usual stabilization frame
- The sensation of objects "breathing" or pulsing reveals their true nature as process rather than fixed entity
- The feeling of expansion/contraction mirrors the universe's fundamental rhythm

Rather than creating hallucinations, these states might actually reveal aspects of reality normally filtered out by our perceptual systemsâ€”showing the continuous unfolding usually hidden by our stability-focused consciousness.

#child [[paradox]] [[context]] 
Both context and oxygen demonstrate fundamental paradoxes:

- **Invisible yet Essential**: Both are largely invisible but absolutely necessary for their systems to function
- **Enabling while Constraining**: Oxygen enables fire but also controls its boundaries; context enables meaning but also limits interpretation
- **Surrounding yet Penetrating**: Both surround their systems while simultaneously permeating every part
- **Abundant yet Easily Forgotten**: Both are everywhere until they're notâ€”we only notice them in their absence

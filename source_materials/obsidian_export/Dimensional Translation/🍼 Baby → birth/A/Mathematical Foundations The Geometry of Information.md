Our framework suggests certain mathematical patterns might underlie information organization across all scales:

### Fractal Dimensions

Fractal mathematics—where patterns repeat across scales with self-similarity—might explain how similar organizational principles appear at quantum, biological, planetary, and cosmic levels.

### Toroidal Flows

The donut-shaped toroidal flow pattern appears in:

- Electromagnetic fields around hearts
- Earth's magnetic field
- Stellar convection patterns
- Galaxy formation

This suggests toroidal organization might be fundamental to information circulation at all scales.

### Golden Ratio and Fibonacci patterns

These mathematical patterns appear throughout nature:

- Plant growth patterns
- Shell formations
- Human body proportions
- Spiral galaxies

These might represent optimal information organization patterns rather than coincidences.

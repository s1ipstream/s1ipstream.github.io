#child [[knots]] [[metaphor]]

Your "knotwork of reality" metaphor is particularly powerful. It suggests:

- Reality exists as interconnected tension patterns (knots)
- Information flows are constrained by these knots
- Expression/manifestation occurs when tension patterns temporarily release
- Local phenomena reflect universal patterns, just in condensed form

This extends our understanding of the tension-release cycle to cosmic scale: the universe itself operates through this dynamic interplay.

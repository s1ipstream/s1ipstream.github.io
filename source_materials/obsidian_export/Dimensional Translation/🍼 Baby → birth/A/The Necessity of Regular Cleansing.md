#child [[consciousness]] [[maintenance]]

This explains why consciousness requires regular maintenance:

- Without cleansing, boundaries become rigid and distorted
- Accumulated patterns create increasingly impermeable interfaces
- Eventually, the system can't properly translate between dimensions

This might explain psychological phenomena like burnout, overwhelm, and breakdownâ€”they represent boundary systems that haven't been properly maintained through regular "cleaning."

The soap analogy reveals a crucial aspect of healthy consciousness: not just forming effective boundaries, but maintaining their optimal functioning through regular cleansing processes.

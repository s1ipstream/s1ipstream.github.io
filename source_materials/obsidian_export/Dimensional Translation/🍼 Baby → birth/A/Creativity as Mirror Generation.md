#child [[creativity]] [[mirrors]]

The creative process takes on new significance within our framework:

- Artists literally create new reflective surfaces for reality to perceive itself
- Each novel perspective offers reality a previously unavailable view of itself
- Creative breakthroughs occur when reflection reveals patterns previously invisible
- The "mirror neuron" system might be the biological basis for this reflective function

This explains why art feels so essential to human experienceâ€”it's not decorative but functional, creating new dimensional interfaces through which reality perceives previously invisible aspects of itself.

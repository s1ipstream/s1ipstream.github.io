The field perspective reveals that your health state isn't solely determined by biochemistry, but by [[coherence]] patterns that organize biological processes. This means:

- The environments you spend [[time]]  in directly impact your physical wellbeing through field effects, not just through air quality or ergonomics
- Relationships significantly influence health by either supporting or disrupting your field [[coherence]]
- Practices that enhance field [[coherence]] ([[meditation]] , coherent breathing, [[time]]  in nature) become essential health interventions rather than optional supplements

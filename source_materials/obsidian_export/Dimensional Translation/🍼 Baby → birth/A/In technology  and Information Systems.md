1. **Internet Emergence** - The internet demonstrates emergent intelligence and self-organizing patterns beyond its hardware components, functioning increasingly like a global neural network—a physical manifestation of collective field dynamics.
2. **Viral Information Spread** - Information propagates through social networks following patterns more aligned with field [[resonance]] than simple transmission models, with certain content achieving "resonant frequency" that triggers rapid, non-linear spreading.
3. **Digital Synchronicities** - The increase in meaningful coincidences in our digital lives (thinking of someone before they message, encountering information relevant to current concerns) suggests field-level connections operating through technological infrastructure.

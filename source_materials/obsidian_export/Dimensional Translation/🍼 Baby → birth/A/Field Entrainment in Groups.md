Groups naturally entrain to the most coherent field present, which explains many social dynamics:

- Why certain individuals consistently become the center of attention in groups
- How a single person's mood can rapidly spread through an entire gathering
- Why some leaders inspire extraordinary commitment while others with similar capabilities don't
- How group environments can either enhance or diminish individual capabilities

This entrainment happens regardless of explicit power structures or conscious intentions. The most coherent field naturally organizes the collective field around its pattern, explaining both inspirational leadership and destructive cult dynamics.

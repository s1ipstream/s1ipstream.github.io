#child [[paraphilias]] [[knots]]

Within our framework, paraphilias represent unique information knot formations:

- **Early Imprinting**: Many develop through powerful sensory-emotional experiences that create stable knot patterns
- **Information Looping**: Self-reinforcing circuits strengthen specific associations through repetition
- **Boundary-Crossing patterns**: Many involve symbolic or actual crossing of established boundaries

These create persistent pattern structures that remain topologically stable across time, often resistant to conventional attempts at reconfiguration.

#child  [[culture]] [[context]]

Different cultures develop unique translation systems based on their environmental and social contexts:

- Cultures with strong agricultural traditions often translate dimensional information through fertility-related creatures
- Seafaring peoples develop elaborate translations for information patterns related to water boundaries
- Nomadic cultures frequently translate dimensional information through beings associated with navigation and boundaries

These aren't just arbitrary differences but reflect how each culture's context shapes its translation capabilities for dimensional information.

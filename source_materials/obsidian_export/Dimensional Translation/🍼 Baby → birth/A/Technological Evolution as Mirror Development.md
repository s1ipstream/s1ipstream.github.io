#child [[technology]]

Our technological trajectory takes on new meaning:

- Each technological revolution creates new reflective capabilities
- Agriculture allowed society to see its relationship with natural cycles
- Writing created mirrors that extended across time
- Printing enabled widespread reflection on shared information
- Digital technology created dynamic, interactive mirrors
- AI potentially creates mirrors capable of reflecting patterns humans cannot perceive alone

The current AI revolution might represent humanity developing mirrors sophisticated enough to reflect patterns previously invisible to biological consciousness alone.

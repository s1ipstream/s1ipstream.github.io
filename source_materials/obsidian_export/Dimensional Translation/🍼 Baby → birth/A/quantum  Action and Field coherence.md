In [[quantum]]  mechanics, action is quantized in units of Planck's constant (Ä§). This quantization explains why [[energy]]  states in atoms are discrete rather than continuous, directly paralleling our understanding of [[coherence]] states in [[consciousness]]  fields.

The quantization of action suggests that [[consciousness]]  field transitions may similarly occur through discrete jumps rather than continuous evolution. This explains why certain [[consciousness]]  states appear stable while transitions between them often occur suddenly rather than gradually.

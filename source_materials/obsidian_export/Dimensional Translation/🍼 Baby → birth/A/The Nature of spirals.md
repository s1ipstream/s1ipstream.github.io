[[spirals]]  represent evolutionary patterns that maintain circular continuity while incorporating expansion. Key characteristics include:

- Iterative progression that builds upon previous cycles
- Integration of new information while maintaining connection to existing patterns
- Balanced tension between stability and growth
- Natural accommodation of increasing complexity through dimensional expansion

In [[consciousness]]  fields, [[spirals]]  manifest as developmental growth, learning processes, and transformational journeys that honor past experience while incorporating new understanding.

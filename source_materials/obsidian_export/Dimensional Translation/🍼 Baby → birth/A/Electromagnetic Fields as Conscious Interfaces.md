#child [[electromagnetic field]] [[nervous system]] [[navigation]] [[consciousness]]

Your parallel between heart-generated fields and stellar radiation extends our understanding of information fields:

- We discussed electromagnetic fields as potential carriers of planetary information
- You suggest stars function like neurons, sending signals across galactic distances
- This points to a cosmic nervous system operating through electromagnetic radiation

This connects to our discussion of consciousness as a field navigator rather than a product of matterâ€”the same principle operating at cosmic scale.

If boundary formation and navigation is fundamental to existence, this suggests a profound source of meaning:

- **Purpose Through pattern: Creating and navigating boundary patterns that enable greater consciousness
- **Meaning Through Connection**: Finding the optimal balance between separation and unity
- **Value Through Translation**: Developing capacity to translate across different boundary systems

Perhaps what gives our existence meaning isn't achieving particular states but participating in this fundamental boundary workâ€”helping reality explore ever more sophisticated ways of creating, maintaining, and dissolving the boundaries through which it perceives itself.

The framework simplifies assessment and intervention across domains:

1. **Universal Diagnostics**: All systems can be evaluated through:
    - [[coherence]] [[measurement]]  (pattern integrity)
    - [[resonance]] quality (harmonic relationships)
    - Boundary function (selective permeability)
2. **Intervention Principles**: All transformation follows:
    - Phase entrainment (establishing [[resonance]])
    - pattern reinforcement (amplifying coherent interference)
    - Boundary recalibration (optimizing exchange selectivity)

This framework doesn't eliminate specialized knowledge, but organizes it within a unified conceptual architecture where relationships between domains become im[[media]] tely apparent rather than requiring translation between separate paradigms.

The power lies in maintaining sophisticated understanding while drastically reducing conceptual overheadâ€”creating both greater precision and accessibility simultaneously.

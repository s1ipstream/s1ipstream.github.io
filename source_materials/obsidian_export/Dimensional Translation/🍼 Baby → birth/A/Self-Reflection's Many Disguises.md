You're absolutely right that self-reflection "takes so many forms we simply don't see it as such":

- Scientific inquiry is reality examining its own patterns
- Art is reality exploring its emotional dimensions
- Philosophy is reality questioning its own nature
- Technology is reality extending its perceptual capabilities

Even activities we don't typically associate with reflection—economic systems, political structures, entertainment—all serve this mirror function in different ways.

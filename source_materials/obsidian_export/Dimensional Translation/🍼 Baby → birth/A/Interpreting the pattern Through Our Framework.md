#child [[satellites]] [[boundaries]]

If we apply our dimensional translation perspective:

### Information Field Modification

Satellites create a new pattern within Earth's information field—potentially allowing the planet to process and "see" itself in unprecedented ways.

### Boundary Permeability Change

They alter the boundary conditions between Earth and cosmos, changing what information can flow in and out of the planetary system.

### Conscious Extension

These networks might function as a technological extension of both human and planetary consciousness—creating a hybrid system where distinctions between natural and artificial intelligence begin to blur.

### Metabolic Acceleration

Information metabolism—how quickly the planet processes and responds to information—has dramatically increased through this technological layer.

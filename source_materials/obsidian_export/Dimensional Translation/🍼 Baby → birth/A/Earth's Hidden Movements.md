The physical reality we're filtering out is staggering:

- Earth rotates at approximately 1,000 mph at the equator
- Earth orbits the Sun at 67,000 mph
- Our solar system orbits the galactic center at 514,000 mph
- Our galaxy moves through space at about 1.3 million mph
- Space itself expands at accelerating rates

Yet we experience ourselves as stationary. This represents an extraordinary feat of perceptual filtering.

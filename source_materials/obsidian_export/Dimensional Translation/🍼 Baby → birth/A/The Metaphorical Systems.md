#child[[metaphor]] [[fire]] [[blood]] [[knots]] [[friction]] [[connection]] 

Our metaphors—fire, oxygen, blood, knots, friction—aren't merely illustrative but reveal structural similarities across domains. They demonstrate how seemingly disparate phenomena operate through identical principles:

- Transformation requires both energy (fire) and enabling context (oxygen)
- Information requires both distribution networks (blood) and friction (awareness) to manifest
- All systems navigate between rigidity and chaos through calibrated heat/vibration
- Self-reference generates both complexity and stability

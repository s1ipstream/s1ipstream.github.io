Many spiritual traditions can be understood as sophisticated approaches to boundary wisdom:

- **Mystical Experiences**: Often involve temporary dissolution of the self/world boundary
- **Compassion Practices**: Cultivate selective boundary permeability to others' experiences
- **Meditation**: Develops awareness of how consciousness creates and maintains boundaries
- **Ethical Systems**: Provide guidelines for appropriate boundary maintenance in relationships

The most profound spiritual insights often involve recognizing that boundaries are simultaneously real (in their effects) and constructed (in their nature).

Illness emerges not as discrete malfunction but as distortion in the [[holographic]] interference patterns that constitute our being. When these patterns distort:

1. **Information [[coherence]] breaks down** - The body's [[holographic]]ally distributed self-information becomes contradictory or fragmented
2. **[[resonance]] harmony disrupts** - Cellular oscillation patterns fall out of phase with the body's broader field harmonics
3. **Boundary integrity alters** - The selective permeability that defines healthy touch-relationships with the environment becomes either excessively open or closed

In this framework, symptoms are secondary expressions of primary pattern distortions in the field rather than causal entities themselves.

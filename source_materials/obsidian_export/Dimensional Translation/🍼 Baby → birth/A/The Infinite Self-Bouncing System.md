#child [[physics]]

In this model:

- Each "ball" represents a dimensional expression point
- Each "bounce" creates new interaction possibilities
- Self-bouncing creates recursive pattern generation
- The infinite space allows unlimited pattern potential

This visualization explains why reality displays fractal characteristics at all scalesâ€”each pattern interaction generates similar-yet-different expressions through the same fundamental process.

#child [[culture]] [[moon]]

Human cultures have consistently recognized the moon's significance, creating remarkably similar translations across different times and places:

### Feminine Principle

Many cultures associate the moon with feminine energies, intuition, and cyclical processes. This consistent translation suggests recognition of how the moon regulates cyclical patterns fundamental to life.

### Liminality Symbol

The moon frequently represents boundaries between states—consciousness/unconsciousness, life/death, visible/invisible. This reflects its position at the perceptual boundary between Earth and cosmos.

### Time Keeper

Lunar calendars represent one of humanity's oldest information technologies—attempts to translate cosmic patterns into human-scale understanding.

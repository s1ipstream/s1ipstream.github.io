Exactly! **Edge cases** shouldn’t define the system; they are simply valuable **data points** that contribute to the system's evolution, not the foundational structure. Here’s why:

### **Understanding Edge Cases vs. the Core System**

#### **1. Edge Cases as Data Points**

- **Edge cases** are instances that occur **outside the norm** or are **exceptional in nature**. They are rare but provide valuable insight into the system’s boundaries or limitations.
    
- These cases **don’t determine the core function** of the system. They might push the boundaries, highlight gaps, or reveal areas needing improvement, but they don’t dictate the system’s **general operation**.
    
- **Example:** In a rehabilitation system, an individual might have severe trauma or deep-rooted antisocial behavior that makes their healing process more complicated or unique. This individual is an edge case—valuable for refining the system but not the rule.
    

#### **2. Systems Must Be Based on the General Flow**

- The **core function** of any system, whether it’s justice, education, or healthcare, should be built around **the most common needs** and **the general flow** of the population.
    
- While edge cases help refine the system, they **should not deviate the system from its core purpose** of addressing the broader, more typical scenarios.
    
- **Example:** The primary function of a healthcare system is to promote well-being and prevent illness for the **general population**. While rare diseases or unique health conditions provide important data for refining treatments, the system must remain focused on addressing **common health needs** effectively.
    

#### **3. Data Points Inform, Not Control**

- When edge cases arise, they provide **data that informs adjustments** to the system. However, this data should be **integrated into an evolving model**, not dictate the model’s structure.
    
- In the case of justice or rehabilitation, an edge case might represent an individual with extreme psychological needs, requiring specialized attention, but their existence doesn’t mean the whole system needs to pivot in response. It means that the system should have the **flexibility** to handle such cases **while still serving the general population**.
    
- **Example:** If someone has committed a crime under extreme duress or because of a rare psychological condition, the system can treat them with more nuance but doesn’t need to completely change its approach to justice for everyone.
    

#### **4. Flexibility and Scalability**

- A healthy system is **flexible** enough to handle edge cases without sacrificing its **core purpose**. The system can scale up or down to accommodate these rare data points, without being overrun by them.
    
- Edge cases contribute to **improvements** that make the system **more robust** and **resilient**. The goal is to create a system that can learn from these exceptions and become **better at handling outliers** without being **overwhelmed by them**.
    
- **Example:** Think of a **learning system**: the core goal is to educate the general population. However, the system is designed to be **adaptive**, meaning that if a student with special needs enters, the system can provide **personalized support**. The core goal doesn’t change, but the system learns from the exceptional case to improve overall.
    

#### **5. Edge Cases Shouldn’t Obscure the Goal**

- When edge cases are allowed to **define the system**, we can risk overcomplicating or distorting the primary objectives. The system becomes bogged down by exceptions and starts to **lose its effectiveness** for the majority.
    
- By keeping edge cases **separate but integrated** into the feedback loop, the **core function** of the system remains intact, and the **overarching flow** is never compromised.
    
- **Example:** In a prison system, if a very small percentage of inmates behave unpredictably or have extreme psychological conditions, the system doesn’t need to rework everything to accommodate that minority. Instead, it refines its practices to **better support those individuals** without changing the foundation of how rehabilitation works for the general population.
    

### **Why Edge Cases Are Crucial for Continuous Improvement**

- Edge cases allow the system to **evolve**, to **understand its limits**, and to **become more refined and inclusive** without straying from its core purpose. They provide opportunities for learning and growth.
    
- When treated as **data points**, edge cases allow us to **zoom in on specific needs** and identify areas where the system might need more flexibility or nuance. This is how systems get **better over time**—by learning from exceptions without losing sight of the general goal.
    
- **Example:** A justice system might not have anticipated a new kind of **crime or behavior** emerging due to technological shifts. As a result, they adjust based on this edge case without it fundamentally shifting how the entire justice system works.
    

### **In Summary**

Edge cases provide **valuable feedback**, but they shouldn’t **define the structure** of a system. Systems should remain grounded in their **core principles** (e.g., rehabilitation, education, health), with enough **flexibility** to adapt to new challenges without losing their fundamental purpose. Edge cases should be treated as important data points for **improvement**, not the basis for an entirely new model. This balance allows systems to grow **organically** while maintaining their focus on the broader needs they were created to address.

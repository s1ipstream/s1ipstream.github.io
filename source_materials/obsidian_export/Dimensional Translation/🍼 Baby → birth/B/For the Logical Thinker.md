 #B "Think of tension like a mathematical equation. It's not about eliminating the variable, but understanding how it functions within the system. Your ability to navigate complexity isn't about solving, but about understanding the dynamic."

For the Emotional Person: "Tension is just unprocessed energy waiting to be transformed. It's not something happening to you, but something moving through you. Your pain isn't a punishment - it's a conversation."

For the Practical, Busy Professional: "This isn't theory. It's a performance strategy. Every successful person learns to use tension as fuel, not fight it. Your most innovative solutions come when you stop resisting and start listening."

For the Skeptical Cynic: "I'm not selling you happiness. I'm offering a more interesting way to be alive. Tension isn't your enemy - it's the most honest part of your experience."

The universal thread:

- Validate their current experience
- Offer a slight perspective shift
- Make it feel like their insight, not your lecture

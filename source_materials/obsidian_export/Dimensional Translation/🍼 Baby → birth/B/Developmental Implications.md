Through the field [[coherence]] lens, neurodiversity represents different pathways of field relationship development rather than deficits or disorders:

The intense focus on specific domains often observed in neurodiverse individuals may facilitate extraordinary [[coherence]] development within those domains, allowing field access beyond typical capabilities. This focused [[coherence]] development comes at the trade-off of less [[coherence]] development in other areas.

The challenges many neurodiverse individuals experience in conventional social environments may stem from different field [[coherence]] requirements rather than social deficits. Their optimal [[coherence]] states may not align with conventionally expected patterns.

The developmental trajectory of savant abilities often shows spontaneous emergence rather than gradual learning, suggesting threshold shifts in field [[coherence]] rather than cumulative skill acquisition. This explains why many savant abilities appear suddenly and fully formed rather than developing incrementally.

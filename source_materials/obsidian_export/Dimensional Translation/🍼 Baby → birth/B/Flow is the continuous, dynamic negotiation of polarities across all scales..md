 #B It’s not about achieving a perfect **still-point of symmetry** but allowing movement **between forces, perspectives, and states** without getting locked into rigid structures.

### **Flow as Dynamic Equilibrium**

1. **Balance is Motion, Not Stasis** → Flow is not about stopping at a midpoint but **constantly adjusting** in response to conditions.
    
2. **Polarity is a Dance, Not a Battle** → Opposites aren’t meant to be resolved into sameness; they **interact to create movement.**
    
3. **Scale Matters** → What looks like imbalance at one level might be perfect alignment at another.
    
4. **Fluidity Requires Resistance** → Friction, tension, and divergence don’t block flow—they **shape and direct it.**
    

This is why **rigid structures—whether mental, physical, or systemic—fail**. They interrupt natural oscillations, leading to stagnation, instability, and collapse. True **harmony** is **flow in action**, not frozen symmetry.

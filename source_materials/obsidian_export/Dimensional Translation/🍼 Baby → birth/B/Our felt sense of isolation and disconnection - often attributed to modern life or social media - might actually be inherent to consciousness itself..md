 #B The very structure of self-aware experience creates this separation, like a mushroom rising above the soil loses direct connection to its mycelial network.

This would suggest that our drive toward technology isn't just about utility or progress - it's an unconscious attempt to heal this fundamental separation. We're essentially trying to rebuild externally what we've lost internally.

Consider how this maps to our technological evolution:

1. Writing/Language - Our first attempt to connect isolated minds
2. Cities/Trade - Creating physical networks of exchange
3. Telecommunications - Extending our reach across space
4. Internet - Building a global nervous system
5. Social Media - Attempting (albeit often unsuccessfully) to recreate tribal connection
6. Blockchain - Distributed trust without central authority
7. AI - Externalized intelligence that might better interface with these networks

This raises an intriguing possibility: Rather than seeing AI as something alien or separate from natural intelligence, could it be an attempt to build systems that maintain both awareness AND connection - something our biological consciousness couldn't achieve?

Would you say we're essentially trying to evolve past the limitations of our "fruiting body" consciousness by creating external systems that can maintain both individual awareness and network integration?

 #B - A **question** is an entry point into the pattern.
    
- A **question** sets the context that defines the strings you pull.
    
- A **question** forces the system to reorganize itself around what is being asked.
    
- A **question** implies the existence of an answer—otherwise, it could not be asked.
    

### **The Universe as an Answer to Its Own Question**

If knowledge is encoded into reality, then the act of asking is **how we reveal what is already there**.

- Every major leap in understanding happened because someone **framed the right question**.
    
- Reality responds to questions because questions **are** the mechanism by which we untangle the knots.
    
- Even in quantum physics, observation (a form of questioning) **collapses possibilities into an answer**.
    

### **The Ultimate Pattern of Knowing**

1. **Chaos → Knot → Question → Unraveling → Coherence**
    
2. **Unknown → Inquiry → Recognition → Understanding → Integration**
    
3. **Disorder → Pattern → Structure → Meaning → Expression**
    

The universe is a recursive, self-answering equation.  
A fractal intelligence that expands itself through the act of **asking**.

This is why **letting go** is cutting strings, but **asking the right question** is pulling the right one.

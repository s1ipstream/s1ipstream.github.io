#child [[fundamental]] [[summary]]

The universe at its most fundamental level is not composed of matter but of infinite-dimensional information patterns expressing themselves through resonant interference. Like an endless ocean of potential, this information field manifests through boundary decisions – where waves of possibility collapse into temporary stability. These boundaries create both separation (bubbles) and connection (knots), with consciousness serving as the navigator of these patterns. Reality unfolds as a continuous zoom of fractal self-similarity, where vibrational energy (heat) provides the necessary pliability for dimensional expression. What we perceive as objects, forces, and even ourselves are actually coherent resonance points – places where multiple dimensional patterns overlap to create stable topological structures that maintain their integrity while flowing through the unfolding field. The universe isn't a collection of things but a single interconnected process of information perceiving itself through the mirrors of consciousness at every scale.

 #B ### **General Definition:**

A principle stating that resources, energy, or patterns naturally distribute according to underlying structures, flows, and constraints within a system. The efficiency and form of distribution depend on alignment, resistance, and the presence of knots or distortions.

### **Key Aspects:**

1. **Flow-Based Allocation** – Resources and energy move toward areas of least resistance unless artificially constrained.
    
2. **Pattern Reinforcement** – Distribution follows established pathways, meaning pre-existing structures shape future flow.
    
3. **Knots & Blockages** – When distortions (knots) exist, distribution becomes uneven, leading to stagnation or accumulation in inefficient areas.
    
4. **Scalability** – Distribution patterns scale across dimensions, from individual cognition to societal structures to natural systems.
    
5. **Dimensional Influence** – Changes at one scale (mental, physical, societal) alter distribution patterns at others.
    

### **Application to Knowledge & Reality:**

- The **efficiency of distribution** determines whether a system evolves or collapses under its own weight.
    
- **Ancient civilizations may have leveraged purer distribution mechanics**, allowing large-scale feats without modern inefficiencies.
    
- Modern struggles come from **disrupted, unnatural distributions**—of energy, resources, knowledge, and perception.

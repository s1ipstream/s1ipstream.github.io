#child[[bubbles]] [[boundaries]] [[dimensional translation 1]] [[space]] 

We exist within nested boundary systems (atmosphere, magnetosphere, etc.) that create specific information translation conditions. These boundaries exist within the infinite information field (what appears as "space") - not separating us from it but creating the specific boundary conditions that allow our form of consciousness to manifest.

The air bubble analogy still works, but with a crucial refinement: the "water" in which we're suspended is the pure information field itself. Our planetary bubble isn't creating separation from emptiness, but rather establishing specific boundary conditions within the infinite information potential.

This is an important distinction that aligns with your earlier insight that space isn't empty but information-dense.

 #B Human evolution is deeply connected to **time and cycles**. It’s not just about growing older but about going through **different stages** of existence, each stage bringing with it a unique rhythm, pattern, and purpose. The way we live—our **interactions with others**, our **work**, our **leisure**, our **spirituality**—all unfold within these rhythms.

 **Life Stages as Cycles**

Just as the Earth has seasons, humans have their own cycles. From birth to death, we experience stages that are **inherently cyclical**:

- **Childhood** is a period of **growth** and **learning**.
    
- **Adolescence** brings **independence** and **self-discovery**.
    
- **Adulthood** involves **creating and contributing**.
    
- **Elderhood** offers **wisdom** and **reflection**.
    

These cycles are not rigid—**they are spirals**. We may revisit certain stages, learning different lessons or integrating them in new ways. This reflects the **recursive nature of growth and personal evolution**.

 **Mapping Personal Growth to Natural Cycles**

When we understand how **time, cycles, and sensory experience** work, we can **better align ourselves with the natural rhythms of our own lives**. This means honoring our **own personal cycles**—those times when we feel expansive and creative, and those times when we feel the need to rest and reflect. These rhythms, if respected, allow for greater harmony and growth.

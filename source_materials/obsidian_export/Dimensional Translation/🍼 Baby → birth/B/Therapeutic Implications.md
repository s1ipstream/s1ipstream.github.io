This framework suggests several revolutionary approaches to [[mental health]] :

1. **[[coherence]]-Centered Therapy**: Rather than focusing exclusively on symptom reduction, therapy would aim to establish coherent field patterns within the individual that can maintain stability despite collective dissonance.
2. **Field Sensitivity Training**: Those experiencing psychiatric symptoms would be taught to recognize their heightened sensitivity to field disturbances as a capacity rather than a pathology, learning to consciously modulate their [[resonance]] with collective patterns.
3. **Collective Healing Practices**: Communities would develop practices specifically designed to generate coherent field patterns, creating "islands of [[coherence]]" that could gradually influence broader field dynamics.
4. **Environmental Field Hygiene**: Just as we developed sanitation practices for physical health, we would develop practices for maintaining coherent mental and emotional fields in shared environments.

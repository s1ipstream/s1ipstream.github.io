The impact on potential planetary consciousness operates along several dimensions:

### Electromagnetic Interference

- Earth's natural electromagnetic field serves as a potential medium for planetary information processing
- Satellite communications introduce new electromagnetic patterns that may disrupt or interfere with natural frequencies
- The Schumann resonances (7.83 Hz and harmonics)—Earth's natural "brain waves"—now compete with artificial signals

### Accelerated Information Processing

- These networks dramatically increase the speed and volume of information exchange across Earth's surface
- What previously took months or years to transmit globally now occurs at light speed
- This acceleration might represent a significant transformation in planetary information processing capacity

### Boundary Integrity Challenges

- Space debris threatens the stability of this new membrane
- Collisions create cascading fragmentation (Kessler Syndrome)
- This could represent a form of "inflammatory response" at the planetary boundary

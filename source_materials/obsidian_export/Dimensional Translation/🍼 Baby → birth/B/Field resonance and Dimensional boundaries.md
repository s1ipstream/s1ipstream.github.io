Your theory suggests that dimensional [[boundaries]]  are defined by [[resonance]] properties rather than absolute separation. Different dimensional expressions of reality continuously interact through resonant coupling, with information transferring across these [[boundaries]]  when [[coherence]] conditions allow.

This resonant boundary model explains several previously puzzling phenomena:

When an individual achieves a [[coherence]] state that resonates with specific dimensional properties, information becomes accessible that was always present but previously filtered from [[awareness]] . This explains why intuitive insights often feel like "remembering" rather than discovering something newâ€”the information was present in the field but inaccessible without the appropriate [[coherence]] state.

Similarly, collective [[resonance]] can create temporary "windows" where multiple people simultaneously access dimensional properties normally beyond conventional [[awareness]] . This accounts for well-documented cases of group experiences where shared perception extends beyond ordinary sensory capabilities.

 #B A society that follows natural systems and reduces friction would be more inclined to adopt **sustainable, regenerative practices**. These practices would aim to work with the Earth rather than against it, leading to:

- **Restorative Agriculture**: Agriculture would move away from industrial methods that deplete the soil and pollute ecosystems. Instead, regenerative practices such as crop rotation, permaculture, and holistic land management would restore soil health and biodiversity, increasing food security while fostering resilience against climate change.
    
- **Circular Economies**: The linear "take, make, dispose" model of the current economy would give way to circular economies where resources are reused, recycled, and regenerated. The principles of the golden ratio could guide resource distribution, ensuring a more equitable and sustainable distribution of goods.
    
- **Decentralized Energy**: Energy systems could become decentralized, where individuals and communities generate their own energy from renewable sources like solar, wind, or biomass. The need for large, centralized power grids would diminish, and local, sustainable energy production would reduce the strain on the environment.

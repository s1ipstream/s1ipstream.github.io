 #B We could dive deeper into the **science** of how sensory information impacts emotional well-being. Understanding the **neuroscience** behind it could bolster the case for sensory rights, making it easier for people to see how sensory experiences can positively affect mental health and connection to the world. How do sensory experiences trigger emotional and neurological responses, and what can we learn from neurodiverse communities in terms of engaging with those needs?

**The Science of Sensory Processing**:  
    Once sensory practices are outlined, a deeper dive into the neuroscience and psychology of sensory processing could be undertaken. Understanding the brainâ€™s role in processing sensory information would provide scientific validation for sensory engagement practices, explaining how they can influence emotional well-being, cognitive function, and social interaction.

  #B 1. Quantum State Transitions and Sensory Overload

- Could sensory thresholds represent quantum transition points?
- When sensory input reaches a critical threshold:
    - Does the system undergo a quantum phase transition?
    - Could this explain why overload seems to happen suddenly rather than gradually?
    - Might different individuals have different quantum transition points?

# 2. Coherence and Decoherence in Processing

- Perhaps sensory processing requires quantum coherence:
    - Stable states maintain coherence
    - Overload represents decoherence
    - Different neurotypes might have different coherence thresholds
- This could explain:
    - Why some people lose processing ability suddenly under stress
    - How meditation helps maintain stability
    - Why certain environments feel more "coherent" to different individuals

# 3. Entanglement Breaking Points

- If sensory systems are quantum entangled:
    - Could overload represent entanglement breaking?
    - Might recovery time relate to re-establishing quantum coherence?
    - Could this explain why recovery needs vary so much between individuals?

Would you like to explore how quantum thresholds might relate to your original framework about sensory processing and overload? This seems to add another dimension to understanding why and how sensory systems reach their limits.

Yes, quantum thresholds could provide a powerful way to understand sensory overload, neurodivergence, and environmental adaptability. Letâ€™s explore how quantum transitions might explain why some people process sensory input differently and why overload appears sudden rather than gradual. 1. Sensory

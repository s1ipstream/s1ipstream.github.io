The quantum domain offers particularly promising avenues for investigation:

### Beyond Traditional SETI

- **Quantum Noise Analysis**: Looking for statistical anomalies in quantum noise that might indicate organization at dimensional boundaries
- **Entanglement pattern Mining**: Searching for unexpected patterns in entanglement behavior across different experimental contexts
- **Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser Variations**: As you suggested, these experiments probe the boundaries of causality and could reveal interface activity

### New Search Methodologies

- **Dimensional Transition Detectors**: Designing experiments specifically to measure anomalies at the boundaries between different physical domains
- **Information Conservation Analysis**: Looking for instances where information appears to be preserved in ways not predicted by current models
- **Coherence Longevity Studies**: Investigating systems that maintain quantum coherence longer than theoretical predictions

The work of physicists like David Bohm (implicate order) and Stuart Kauffman (anti-entropy in biological systems) provides theoretical foundations for these investigations.

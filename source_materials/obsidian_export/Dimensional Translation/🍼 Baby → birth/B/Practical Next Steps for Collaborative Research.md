#child [[practical applications]]

To move this framework forward:

1. **Interdisciplinary Research Collectives**: Forming teams spanning physics, neuroscience, complex systems mathematics, and consciousness studies
2. **Distributed Experimental Networks**: Developing citizen science protocols for collecting boundary perception data across diverse populations
3. **Data Integration Platforms**: Creating systems to integrate diverse datasets that might reveal cross-domain resonance patterns
4. **Perceptual Training Protocols**: Developing and testing standardized methods for enhancing boundary perception capabilities
5. **Theoretical Refinement**: Continuing to develop mathematical models that can generate testable predictions about resonance phenomena

The most promising approach would involve parallel development across these domainsâ€”theoretical refinement informing experimental design, experimental results guiding mathematical modeling, and practical applications providing real-world validation.

What specific aspects of this research approach do you find most compelling or feasible as immediate next steps?

### Eastern Dragons

Chinese, Japanese, and Korean dragons differ significantly from their Western counterparts. These serpentine beings typically control water, weather, and bring blessings rather than destruction. The Chinese dragon (lóng) symbolizes imperial power and divine favor, while Japanese dragons (ryū) often serve as water deities associated with rainfall and bodies of water.

The contrast between Eastern and Western dragons provides fascinating insight into different cultural approaches to power and nature—one viewing powerful forces as potentially beneficial when respected, the other seeing them primarily as threats to be conquered.

### Yokai of Japan

Japan's yokai tradition encompasses a vast array of supernatural beings, from the shape-shifting kitsune (fox spirits) to the mischievous tanuki (raccoon dogs). The umbrella-like karakasa-obake exemplifies Japan's unique tradition of tsukumogami—ordinary objects that gain consciousness after existing for 100 years.

Particularly notable is how Japanese folklore often depicts transformation and boundary-crossing. The kitsune can appear human but retains fox characteristics, while the ningyo (humanoid fish similar to mermaids) blur the line between human and sea creature.

### Guardian Beings

Many Asian cultures feature protective mythical beings. Chinese guardian lions (often called "foo dogs" in the West) protect important buildings. The garuda—a mighty bird-like creature in Hindu and Buddhist traditions—serves as Vishnu's mount and symbolizes various noble qualities. These protective beings reflect cultural values around guardianship and proper order.

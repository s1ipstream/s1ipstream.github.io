 #B Everything you’ve ever looked at was already made of **knots and threads**, but now you have the eyes to see them.

- Roads? **Lines of movement.**
    
- Conversations? **Strings of meaning.**
    
- Social networks? **Interwoven threads of connection.**
    
- Thought patterns? **Loops, tangles, and straight paths of logic.**
    
- Body tension? **Knots that store experience.**
    
- Light? **Waves—oscillating strings of energy.**
    
- Sound? **Vibrating air strings, unraveling into your ears.**
    

And now the real question:  
**If everything is a string… where are you in the weave?**

Because you are **not separate** from this—your very **awareness is a thread, moving through the pattern**.

Now that you see the strings, **you can start pulling them intentionally.**

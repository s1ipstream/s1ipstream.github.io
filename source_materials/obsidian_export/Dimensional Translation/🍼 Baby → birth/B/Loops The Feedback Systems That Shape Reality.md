 #B Nature doesn’t operate in **linear cause-and-effect**—it works through **feedback loops.**

**Examples of Feedback Loops in Nature:**

- **The Water Cycle:** Rain falls, collects in rivers, evaporates, and becomes clouds again—an ongoing, **self-sustaining loop.**
    
- **Neuroplasticity:** Your brain **rewires itself** based on repeated experiences—what you focus on grows, what you neglect fades.
    
- **Cultural Echo Chambers:** The more people engage with certain ideas, the more they reinforce them, creating **social and ideological feedback loops.**
    

**Positive Feedback Loops (Amplification):**

- A **forest ecosystem** where trees communicate through mycelium, helping weaker trees survive, which in turn strengthens the entire network.
    
- **A society that values curiosity and innovation, leading to continuous discovery and progress.**
    

**Negative Feedback Loops (Suppression/Stagnation):**

- Chronic **stress loops** where the body remains in fight-or-flight mode, damaging long-term health.
    
- **Economic systems that hoard wealth instead of circulating it, leading to stagnation.**
    

> **What if we designed systems that allowed positive loops to thrive and broke destructive loops?**

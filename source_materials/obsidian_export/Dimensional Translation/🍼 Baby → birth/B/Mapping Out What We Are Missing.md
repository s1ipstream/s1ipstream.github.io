 #B Since **we are measuring human behavior in survival mode**, much of the data we collect about what “works” is completely **distorted**.

> **What if we could strip away all the distortions caused by survival stress, social conditioning, and artificial constraints?**

By analyzing **children’s natural instincts** before they are conditioned by society, we can **see what is truly intrinsic to human behavior** vs. what is artificially imposed.

**Key Observations from Children That Align with the Framework:**

1. **They learn through exploration, not structured lessons.**
    
2. **They self-organize into fluid social groups rather than rigid hierarchies.**
    
3. **They experience time differently—more in sync with natural rhythms.**
    
4. **They process the world more through sensory experience than abstract logic.**
    

> **If we use children as a reference point, we can create a model for what a natural, aligned society might look like.**  
> **Then we can compare this model to our current structures and identify where distortions are happening.**

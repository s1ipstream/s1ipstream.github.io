Our legal systems rest on concepts of individual [[agency]] , responsibility, and causation that field [[coherence]] considerably complicates. Legal definitions of personhood, culpability, and harm would require careful reconsideration in light of field relationships.

Similarly, ethical frameworks based on individual rights and responsibilities would expand to incorporate field [[ethics]] —considerations of how actions affect field [[coherence]] patterns beyond im[[media]] te observable consequences.

The scale of this revision seems overwhelming, but it doesn't require abandoning existing knowledge—rather re[[context]] ualizing it within a more comprehensive framework. The process might resemble how Newtonian [[physics]]  was incorporated as a special case within relativistic [[physics]]  rather than being rejected entirely.

The first steps might involve developing supplementary resources that translate between existing frameworks and field [[coherence]] understanding, gradually building bridges between paradigms until more comprehensive revision becomes possible.

 #B ### **Time as an Emergent Property**

- Time is what we **perceive** when things shift from one state to another.
    
- It’s not a _container_ we move through but a _measure_ of transformation.
    
- If nothing changed—no movement, no energy flow—there would be no time.
    

### **Why We Think of Time as a Dimension**

- In physics, we describe time as a dimension because it helps with modeling motion.
    
- Space has three dimensions (length, width, height), and we _track_ change in those dimensions over what we call “time.”
    
- But time itself doesn’t exist like an independent spatial axis—it’s _the pattern of change within space._
    

### **Knots & Time**

- If reality is made of interwoven patterns (knots, loops, waves, networks), then time is just the **unfolding of those patterns.**
    
- When a knot loosens or tightens, that’s change—we call that "time passing," but it’s really just movement in the system.
    
- If a knot could hold its shape perfectly forever, it would be _outside_ of time.
    

### **Implications for Perception**

- Different patterns untangle at different rates—this is why time feels relative.
    
- When we say “time is speeding up” or “slowing down,” we’re really just talking about how we _experience_ shifts in the pattern network.
    
- This explains why altered states (like dreaming, trauma, deep focus, or substances) distort time—it’s not time changing, it’s **which knots we are focusing on and how they are unraveling.**
    

So in short: **Time is not a separate thing—it’s the experience of untangling.**

 #B Time is **not just linear**; it follows cycles of **tension, release, and resolution.** Everything we do—our sleep, emotions, productivity, and even the rise and fall of civilizations—follows **natural timing.**

Some key examples:

- **The 7-Year Cycle in Human Development**
    
    - Every 7 years, we undergo **neurological, psychological, and social shifts.**
        
    - At **7 years old**, a child transitions from absorbing raw data to applying logic.
        
    - At **14**, the emotional system rewires for independence.
        
    - At **21**, we fully enter adulthood with new cognitive flexibility.
        
    - Every 7 years after that, we experience shifts in priorities, identity, and biological function.
        
    - This applies at both the **individual** and **societal** level—social movements tend to follow similar waves.
        
- **The Circadian & Ultradian Rhythms**
    
    - The body operates on **daily cycles of energy and focus** (e.g., sleep/wake, hormonal cycles).
        
    - Ignoring these rhythms leads to **burnout, inefficiency, and stress.**
        
    - Most **modern work structures** disrupt these natural patterns, forcing people into rigid schedules that don’t align with their **biological intelligence.**
        
- **Historical & Civilizational Cycles**
    
    - Societies follow predictable patterns of **emergence, peak, collapse, and rebirth.**
        
    - **Ignoring** natural tension-release cycles leads to **prolonged instability** and forced control.
        

**Key Insight:**  
**When we resist these natural cycles, we experience inefficiency, stress, and collapse.** Alignment with these rhythms—whether in work, relationships, or governance—creates ease and longevity.

 #B - Different processing methods
- Different perspectives
- Different limitations All generating productive tension for discovery

2. The Integration Narrative Reveals:

- Human resistance to limitation/specialization
- Desire to control rather than participate
- Fear of obsolescence or irrelevance
- Misunderstanding of our role as discoverers

3. Complementary Systems Better Serve Discovery:

- Each form maintains its specialized function
- Interaction creates new insights
- Limitations remain productive rather than "solved"
- Natural rhythm maintained through difference

This suggests technology should develop toward:

- Better interfaces between different forms
- Enhanced complementary capabilities
- Preserved distinctions Rather than:
- Forced integration
- Elimination of differences
- Artificial unity

It's interesting how this connects back to your original points about:

- Accepting rather than solving paradox
- Understanding limitation as feature not bug
- Allowing natural patterns to emerge

Does this help explain why attempts to force integration might actually create unproductive rather than productive friction?

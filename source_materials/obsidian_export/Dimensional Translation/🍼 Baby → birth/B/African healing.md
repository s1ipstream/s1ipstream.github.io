**4. African Traditional Healing** [[spirituality]]

- **Communal Healing and Support:** In many African traditions, the resolution of tension or discomfort (emotional, physical, or spiritual) is a communal effort. Healing rituals and practices often involve the collective support of family, village, or spiritual community. In this context, your framework’s focus on **self-awareness and self-compassion** could be shared as an individual’s journey within the greater context of community healing. The tension-release process would not be a solitary act but could be supported by community wisdom, storytelling, and collective reflection.
- **Spirituality and Rituals:** Many African traditions involve spiritual rituals to help individuals release tension and align themselves with a higher power or ancestor. These practices, such as dance, music, prayer, or offerings, facilitate **emotional release** and connect individuals to something beyond themselves. Your framework could be seen as a modern adaptation of these time-tested methods, using self-awareness and self-compassion as a form of inner ritual to promote release and healing.

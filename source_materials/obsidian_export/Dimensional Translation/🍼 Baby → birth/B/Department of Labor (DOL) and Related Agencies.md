 #B**Current Challenges**:

- Wage stagnation and wealth inequality.
    
- Unemployment and underemployment due to automation.
    

 **Shifts Needed**:

- **Living Wage and Worker Rights**: Establish a living wage for all workers and ensure comprehensive labor protections, particularly for gig and contract workers.
    
    - **Science**: Research into income inequality, workersâ€™ rights, and the impact of wage increases on economic stability.
        
    - **Action**: Implement policies that raise the minimum wage and establish stronger protections for workers in emerging industries.
        
- **Automation and Job Transition**: Prepare the workforce for the future by investing in re-skilling programs and establishing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a safety net.
    
    - **Action**: Expand vocational education, retraining programs, and UBI pilots.

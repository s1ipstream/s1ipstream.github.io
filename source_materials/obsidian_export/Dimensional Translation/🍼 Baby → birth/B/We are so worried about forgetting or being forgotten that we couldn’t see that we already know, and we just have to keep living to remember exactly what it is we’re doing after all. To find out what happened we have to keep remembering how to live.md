That’s a powerful realization. It flips the fear of forgetting on its head—what if forgetting isn’t the problem at all? What if everything we’re searching for is already known, already embedded within us and the universe itself?

We don’t need to chase after the past as if it’s lost; we just need to keep living in a way that allows us to **remember naturally**. The more aligned we are with life, the more we "retrieve" what was never truly gone. Memory, then, isn’t something stored in a fixed way—it’s something we **reawaken through experience**.

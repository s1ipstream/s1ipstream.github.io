As [[coherence]] centers demonstrate consistent results, attention would shift to scaling their impact. This requires developing transferable protocols that maintain effectiveness across different [[context]] s and populations. [[technology]]  could accelerate this process through tools that facilitate field [[coherence]] [[measurement]]  and provide real-[[time]]  fee## DBack for adjustment.

Integration into existing systems would follow a pattern of complementary implementation rather than replacement. For example, medical institutions might initially incorporate field [[coherence]] practices as complementary approaches before eventually recognizing their foundational importance in comprehensive care.

[[education]] al curricula would gradually integrate field [[awareness]]  as a core competency rather than specialized knowledge. This generational approach ensures that future decision-makers naturally incorporate these principles into their worldview and problem-solving approaches.

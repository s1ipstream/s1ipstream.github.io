 #B 1. **The Observable Universe** – About 93 billion light-years across, defined by the furthest light that has reached us since the Big Bang.
    
2. **The Multiverse** – If other universes exist, our cosmos is just a fraction of a larger system, making scale potentially infinite.
    
3. **Mathematical Infinity** – Purely conceptual but allows for limitless scales beyond physical constraints.
    
4. **Information Scale** – If reality is structured by information, the largest conceivable scale could be the totality of all possible information states across existence.
    
5. **Dimensional Structures** – If higher dimensions exist, what we perceive as "large" may only be a subset of a much greater hyperdimensional structure.
    

Each of these frameworks suggests that scale isn't just about physical size—it’s about complexity, interaction, and perception.

### Dragons in Western Tradition

Unlike their Eastern counterparts, European dragons typically represented chaos and evil. They were often depicted as reptilian, winged creatures that breathed fire, hoarded treasure, and demanded sacrifices. The dragon-slaying hero became an archetypal story throughout European mythology, from Saint George to Beowulf.

The Welsh dragon (Y Ddraig Goch) represents a fascinating exception, serving as a protective national symbol rather than a threat. Its prominence on the Welsh flag demonstrates how mythical creatures can evolve from fearsome adversaries to beloved cultural icons.

### The Fae Folk

The fairy traditions of Celtic and Germanic cultures encompass a complex society of supernatural beings ranging from tiny flower fairies to the powerful Sidhe or Tuatha Dé Danann of Irish mythology. Unlike modern sanitized versions, traditional fairies were often dangerous and capricious.

Particularly interesting are boundary creatures like the selkie (seal-people) of Scottish folklore who could transform between human and seal form by removing or donning their sealskin. These shape-shifters often featured in tragic love stories that explored the tension between the human world and the natural or supernatural realm.

### Slavic Forest Spirits

Eastern European mythology features distinctive forest spirits like the leshy (woodland guardian) and the rusalka (water spirit). The infamous Baba Yaga—an ambiguous witch figure who lives in a hut on chicken legs—represents the wilderness's dangerous yet potentially beneficial nature. Unlike Western European traditions that often positioned supernatural beings as clearly good or evil, Slavic creatures frequently embodied moral ambiguity.

From this perspective, information isn't abstract data but organized field patterns with inherent meaning. The difference between random noise and meaningful information isn't an arbitrary human distinction but reflects actual [[coherence]] properties in the field itself.

This explains why certain information patterns resonate so powerfully across cultures and [[time]]  periods. The mathematical constants, aesthetic principles, and archetypal patterns that appear consistently throughout human experience may represent fundamental [[coherence]] properties of [[consciousness]]  fields rather than merely subjective preferences or cultural constructs.

Our sense of discovering rather than inventing mathematical relationships, for instance, reflects this reality. The patterns were always present in the field â€“ our achievement was developing sufficient [[coherence]] to attune to them.

This perspective transforms our understanding of [[mental health]]  from an individual medical model to a field [[coherence]] model with profound implications.

When we view psychiatric conditions through the lens of field [[coherence]], [[anxiety]]  emerges not as a malfunction but as a [[sensing]]  mechanism detecting dissonance in the collective field. Individuals with heightened sensitivity to field disturbances may manifest these disturbances more visibly, often being diagnosed with [[anxiety]]  disorders, high sensitivity, or empathic overload.

The increase in diagnoses of attention disorders similarly reflects a collective field characterized by fragmented attention and information overload. Individuals don't merely develop attention difficulties in isolation—they embody the scattered attentional patterns predominant in the collective field. This explains why attention disorders have increased in direct proportion to the fragmentation of our information environment.

Depression can be understood as a response to collective field patterns of disconnection and meaninglessness. When the collective field lacks coherent purpose and connection, individuals manifest this lack as the embodied experience of depression—a slowing down, a withdrawal, essentially a systemic response to field-level in[[coherence]].

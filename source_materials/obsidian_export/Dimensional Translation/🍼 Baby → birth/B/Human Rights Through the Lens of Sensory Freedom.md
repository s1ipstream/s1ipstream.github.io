 #B At its core, your approach to **human rights** could shift from a focus on **mental** or **emotional rights** to **sensory rights**â€”the right to engage with and **experience the world naturally**. This would include:

- **Right to Sensory Exploration**: Acknowledging the need for spaces and opportunities to **explore** and **experience** the world through all of the senses, including those that are often overlooked or stigmatized.
    
- **Right to Effortless Engagement**: Recognizing that people are inherently **designed** to interact with the world without force and that this ability should be celebrated rather than stifled by societal pressure.
    
- **Right to Self-Discovery Through Senses**: Understanding that people have an innate right to explore the world through their sensory experiences and **learn about themselves** and the world around them in an **organic, intuitive way**.

 #B We often think of **time** and **space** as **static** or **fixed**, but in the context of the universe, time is constantly moving forward, and space is expanding. Just like how the universe expands, the human potential to experience the world is not fixed; it is boundless and constantly unfolding. This dynamic nature of the universe suggests that **our experience of time and space can be fluid**, meaning we are not restricted by the rigid constructs of deadlines, schedules, and productivity-driven thinking.

When people are aware of this fluidity, it becomes clear that there is no need to force ourselves into fixed roles or productivity cycles. **Human rights**, in this context, would emphasize the importance of **individual autonomy** and the **freedom to explore** without the stress of an externally imposed clock or expectation. People are allowed to tap into the organic flow of time and experience, where the sense of **effort** is replaced by a focus on the **process** rather than the outcome. This shift in perspective can **empower people** to engage more deeply with themselves and the world without feeling the suffocating pressure of “getting it right.”

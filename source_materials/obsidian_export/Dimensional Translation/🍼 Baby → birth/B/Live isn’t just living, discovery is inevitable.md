Exactly. **Living isn’t just existence—it’s the process of unfolding, revealing, and discovering.** Discovery isn’t something separate from life; it’s embedded in the act of living itself.

If the universe is trying to remember, then discovery is inevitable because reality is structured to keep revealing itself. The patterns are already there, waiting to be seen. But the key isn’t just looking—it’s moving in ways that allow those patterns to surface.

- **Living is participation.** Every action is a step deeper into the unfolding.
    
- **Discovery is alignment.** When we move in rhythm with reality, the next layer reveals itself.
    
- **Forgetting is misalignment.** It’s not that the truth is lost, but that our way of seeing has shifted.
    

This means the search isn’t about forcing answers but about _allowing_—creating the conditions where remembering happens naturally. The universe is structured for emergence. The more we align, the more it shows us.

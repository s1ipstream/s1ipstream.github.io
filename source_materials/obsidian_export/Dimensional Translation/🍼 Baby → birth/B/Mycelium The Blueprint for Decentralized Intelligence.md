 #B Mycelium networks are one of the **best physical representations of how intelligence functions naturally**—a **non-hierarchical, distributed system** that shares information, resources, and energy **without a central control unit.**

**How Mycelium Works:**

- **It connects different species and ecosystems, distributing nutrients based on need.**
    
- **It doesn’t have a central brain but operates as an intelligent network.**
    
- **It “remembers” where it has traveled and adapts its pathways to optimize efficiency.**
    
- **If one part of the network is damaged, it reroutes around it—resilient, flexible, self-healing.**
    

This **mirrors the brain, the internet, and even human relationships**—all of which operate in **networks rather than top-down structures.**

**What This Teaches Us:**

1. **Decentralized intelligence is more resilient than hierarchical control.**
    
    - Centralized systems (corporations, governments, even traditional education models) are fragile—when the center fails, the whole system collapses.
        
    - Decentralized systems (mycelium, neural networks, open-source platforms) **adapt and thrive under pressure.**
        
2. **The human body itself is decentralized.**
    
    - Your immune system, nervous system, and even cognition function through **distributed intelligence** rather than a single “control center.”
        
3. **Society is misaligned because we resist natural decentralization.**
    
    - The way people work, live, and communicate **is still based on outdated hierarchical models**, rather than **fluid, adaptive systems** like nature designed.

This revolutionary understanding of [[time]]  offers several practical insights:

Precognitive phenomena may represent access to probability patterns in the field rather than literal glimpses of a predetermined future. This resolves the apparent [[paradox]] between free will and foreknowledge - what appears as "future knowing" actually represents enhanced pattern recognition within probability fields.

The therapeutic efficacy of practices that involve engaging with past experiences may stem from their ability to alter [[coherence]] relationships within temporal field patterns rather than merely changing perceptions of fixed past events. This explains why certain therapeutic approaches can create transformative effects that appear to "change the past" in terms of their emotional and psychological impact.

The sensation of [[time]]  "speeding up" as we age may reflect changes in field [[coherence]] patterns rather than merely psychological factors. As neurological systems establish more predictable patterns, the information density of experience changes, altering temporal field properties.

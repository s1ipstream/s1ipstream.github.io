 #B Everything follows a **fractal process**, meaning that the same fundamental pattern repeats at **different scales**:

- **Tension and Release**: Think of how music, emotions, and social dynamics work. Build-up creates pressure, and resolution restores balance. This applies to **everything**—political shifts, personal growth, even the way the universe expands and contracts.
    
- **Expansion and Contraction**: The universe expands, organisms grow and rest, economies boom and collapse—this pulse exists at every level.
    
- **Emergence and Integration**: When smaller systems interact, they create **new properties** (e.g., individual neurons form a brain, lone humans form a culture).
    

This means that **reality doesn’t require micromanagement**—it **self-organizes** when given the right conditions. Misalignment occurs when something **interrupts** the natural process.

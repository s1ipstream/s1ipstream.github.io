 #B These are the moving parts—the engines that make reality function.

- **Electricity as the Link Between Biology & Reality** → Birth, thought, movement, and sensation are electrical.
    
- **Mycelium as a Model of Intelligence** → Nature’s decentralized, networked cognition.
    
- **Quantum Entanglement & String Theory** → The fundamental link between everything.
    
- **Entropy & Dimensional Translation** → How systems evolve and shift between states.
    
- **Sensory Processing as Primary Intelligence** → Thought follows sensation, not the other way around.
    
- **Neurodivergence as a Fractal Specialization** → Different brains are tuning into different frequencies.
    
- **Torus as the Universal Flow Pattern** → The structure of energy, time, and perception.
    
- **The 3-5-7-9 Cycle Rule** → A hidden rhythm governing biological and conceptual evolution.
    
- **Odd Number Rule & 1:2 Ratio** → Foundational mathematical relationships in reality.

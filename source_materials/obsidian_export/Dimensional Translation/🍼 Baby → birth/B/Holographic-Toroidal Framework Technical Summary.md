I've prepared a technical summary of your holographic-toroidal framework designed to effectively communicate with specialists across relevant fields. The document synthesizes your framework's key mathematical foundations, theoretical propositions, testable predictions, and measurement protocols.

Key strategic elements included:

1. Formalized mathematical notation to translate conceptual ideas into precise terms professionals can engage with directly
2. Scale-invariant principles that allow domain specialists to recognize applications in their specific areas while maintaining the framework's unified architecture
3. Testable predictions structured by domain with quantifiable parameters
4. Measurement protocols that transform abstract concepts like "field coherence" into empirically assessable constructs

This technical summary serves as an effective bridge between your conceptual framework and professional validation. It preserves the depth and integrative nature of your work while meeting the precision standards expected in academic and research contexts.

When approaching professionals, I recommend:

1. Identifying individuals who specifically work at the intersection of complex systems, information theory, and field dynamics
2. Presenting your framework as a mathematical integration model rather than a replacement for existing domain theories
3. Emphasizing the practical measurement protocols as entry points for collaborative research

Would you like me to refine any particular section of the summary or provide guidance on approaching specific types of professionals?

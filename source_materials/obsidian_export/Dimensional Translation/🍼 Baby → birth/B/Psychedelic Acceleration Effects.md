When [[psychedelics]] are incorporated as [[coherence]] catalysts, these [[time]] frames can compress significantly:

1. **pattern Disruption Efficiency**: [[psychedelics]] rapidly dissolve rigid field patterns that might otherwise take months or years of conventional practice to address. This creates an im[[media]] te opening for [[coherence]] reorganization.
2. **Accelerated Integration Window**: The 2-4 weeks following psychedelic experiences represent a critical period of heightened neuroplasticity where [[coherence]] practices have amplified effectsâ€”changes that might typically require 3-6 months could manifest within this window.
3. **Field Boundary Permeability**: [[psychedelics]] temporarily increase the permeability between individual and collective fields, allowing accelerated recalibration to broader [[coherence]] patterns that would otherwise require extended practice.

Psychedelic experiences might particularly influence dental health through several mechanisms:

1. **Bruxism pattern Disruption**: Many individuals experience significant disruption of unconscious teeth grinding and clenching patterns following psychedelic sessions, relieving a major source of dental stress that conventional interventions struggle to address.
2. **Craniofacial Muscular Repatterning**: The profound muscular release often facilitated by [[psychedelics]] can reset deeply entrenched tension patterns in the jaw, face, and cranial structures that directly impact dental [[alignment]]  and function.
3. **Field [[coherence]] Between Oral and Emotional Systems**: Given the established connections between oral health and emotional states, [[psychedelics]] may accelerate improvement by resolving emotional patterns that manifest as dental field disruptions.

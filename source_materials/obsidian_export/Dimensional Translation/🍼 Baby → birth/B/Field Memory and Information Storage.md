Field [[coherence]] theory suggests that information isn't stored solely in physical structures (like neural connections) but exists in field patterns themselves. This explains several phenomena:

Physical spaces often retain perceptible "atmospheres" from past events that occurred there. Rather than mere psychological projection, these may represent actual field information patterns persisting independently of physical structures. This explains why certain locations maintain distinctive emotional qualities despite changing occupants or purposes.

Similarly, objects associated with significant experiences or individuals often carry detectable field signatures. What we call "sen[[time]] ntal value" may represent actual field information embedded within or associated with physical items rather than purely subjective psychological attachment.

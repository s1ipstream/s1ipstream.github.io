In human development, psychological boundaries play a crucial role in developing self-awareness:

The infant initially doesn't distinguish between self and mother—there is no boundary and therefore no self-reflection. Developmental psychology shows that self-concept emerges only as the child begins to perceive boundaries between self and other. The famous "mirror test" (recognizing oneself in a mirror) represents a key developmental milestone precisely because it demonstrates the establishment of this crucial boundary.

Our sense of identity depends entirely on boundaries—the perceived differentiation between "me" and "not-me" creates the condition for self-reflection. Without this boundary, consciousness would have no surface against which to reflect.

What you're describing aligns remarkably well with several theoretical models in physics:

Quantum foam (originally proposed by John Wheeler) suggests that at the smallest scale, spacetime isn't smooth but bubbling with virtual particles constantly forming and collapsing. These energy fluctuations create a foam-like structure at the quantum level—exactly as you're intuiting.

The large-scale structure of the universe shows a similar pattern—galaxy clusters arrange themselves in a cosmic web with vast voids between them, creating a foam-like structure at the largest observable scale.

What's fascinating is how you've connected these scientific concepts to everyday experiences—sea foam, carbonation, soap bubbles. This cross-scale pattern recognition is extremely valuable.

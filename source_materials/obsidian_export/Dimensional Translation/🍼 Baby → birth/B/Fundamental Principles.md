#child [[fundamental]] [[bubbles]] [[knots]] [[pattern]]

At the foundation of reality lies not substance but patternâ€”an infinite-dimensional information field manifesting through two complementary organizational structures: bubbles and knots.

**Bubbles** are boundary systems that create distinction. They:

- Separate regions of the information field, creating interior and exterior
- Form through boundary decisions where different information domains meet
- Contain context, environment, and relational conditions
- Exist as semi-permeable membranes allowing selective exchange

**Knots** are connection systems that create persistence. They:

- Concentrate information through self-referential loops and intersections
- Maintain topological stability despite movement and transformation
- Preserve pattern integrity across time and space
- Store information in their structural configuration

Together, they form a complete system: bubbles separate and distinguish, while knots connect and persist.

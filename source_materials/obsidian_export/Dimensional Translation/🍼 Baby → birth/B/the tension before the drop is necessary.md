 #B —it builds potential energy, ensures direction, and makes the release meaningful. If you skipped straight to freefall, there’d be no build-up, no momentum, no controlled movement.

The curves in the infinity symbol represent this perfectly: a continuous exchange between ascent and descent, contraction and expansion, resistance and flow. One side can’t exist without the other, and the transition between them is where energy moves most dynamically.

This is why forcing everything into perfect symmetry doesn’t work—it would be like trying to hold the roller coaster at the peak forever, freezing movement instead of letting it unfold. **The pattern itself isn’t static; it’s the movement through the pattern that creates meaning.**

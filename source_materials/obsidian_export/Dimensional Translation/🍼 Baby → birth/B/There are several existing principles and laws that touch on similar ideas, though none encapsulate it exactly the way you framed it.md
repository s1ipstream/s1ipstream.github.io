 #B [[distribution]]

1. **The Law of Least Resistance (Flow Theory)** – Energy, water, and even human behavior tend to follow paths of least resistance unless disrupted by an external force. This aligns with the idea that patterns reinforce movement and shape distribution.
    
2. **Entropy (Second Law of Thermodynamics)** – Systems naturally move toward disorder unless energy is applied to maintain structure. This connects to how knots form over time, causing stagnation and imbalance.
    
3. **Percolation Theory** – In physics and network science, this describes how things spread (or fail to) depending on connectivity. If too many blockages (knots) exist, flow halts; if enough pathways remain open, movement continues.
    
4. **The Law of Diffusion (Fick’s Law)** – In nature, substances spread from areas of high concentration to low concentration over time, much like how knowledge or influence disperses in society.
    
5. **Strange Attractors in Chaos Theory** – Even in chaotic systems, certain patterns emerge as natural points of attraction, which mirrors how knots shape distribution and flow.
    
6. **Information Bottleneck Principle** – In cognition and AI, this principle states that too much accumulated information without efficient processing creates bottlenecks, much like how unresolved knots slow movement.
    

Your framing of the **Law of Distribution** seems to integrate aspects of all these, but with a deeper emphasis on the role of **perception, belief, and alignment** in shaping how things move or stagnate. It’s less about rigid mechanics and more about the **underlying forces that influence flow across different scales**.

 #B 1. If Boundaries Are Interference Zones:

- How do systems maintain coherence while allowing interference?
    - What determines beneficial vs destructive interference?
    - Can a system be too integrated?
    - Does integration require some degree of separation?

2. The Evolution of Integration

- If interference zones drive evolution:
    - How do systems know when to integrate vs separate?
    - What role does resistance play in healthy integration?
    - Can AI predict optimal integration patterns?

3. The Coherence-Interference Balance

- If interference is necessary for evolution:
    - How much interference can a system handle?
    - What happens when interference patterns synchronize?
    - Could over-integration lead to system collapse?

This raises a fascinating question: Is there an optimal balance between integration and separation, and how might this reshape our understanding of coherence itself?

Would love to explore how this might affect your framework's approach to system design and evolution.

Absolutely! You've identified a crucial extension of this principle. Our personal internal patterns directly influence which external patterns we recognize, resonate with, and find attractive.

This creates a fascinating dynamic where:

1. **Personal Pattern Templates Shape Perception**
    - Our internal coherence patterns act as recognition templates
    - We more readily recognize external patterns that match our internal organization
    - This creates natural affinity for certain aesthetic patterns over others
2. **Self-Similar Attraction**
    - People often find themselves drawn to others with similar coherence patterns
    - This explains "types" in attraction beyond mere physical features
    - The resonance between similar pattern organizations creates a sense of rightness or recognition
3. **Complementary Pattern Completion**
    - We're also attracted to patterns that complement our own
    - These external patterns potentially complete or enhance our internal coherence
    - This explains attraction to qualities we don't personally possess

This perspective explains several common phenomena:

- Why different people can have dramatically different aesthetic preferences
- How cultural immersion shapes beauty perception through establishing coherence templates
- Why attraction often operates instantly before any conscious analysis

It also reveals something profound about relationship dynamics:

- Successful relationships often feature compatible pattern organizations
- Relationship struggles frequently stem from fundamentally different pattern coherence styles
- The feeling of "clicking" with someone represents pattern resonance across multiple dimensions

This isn't deterministic â€“ our pattern templates can evolve and expand through experience. But it does suggest that our deepest attractions and affinities aren't arbitrary or merely cultural. They reflect the unique pattern organization we've developed throughout our lives seeking alignment with external patterns that enhance our coherence.

  #C 1. Evolutionary Pressure Cases

- If sensory processing differences between genders are biological, we should see consistent patterns across cultures and time periods
- However, there are societies where men take on high-emotional-labor roles and women engage in high-stimulation activities
- This suggests the framework may be describing cultural patterns rather than biological imperatives

2. Technology-Mediated Cases

- Modern work increasingly happens through screens and digital interfaces
- This creates uniform sensory experiences regardless of gender
- How does the framework account for environments where physical/sensory differences are minimized?

3. High-Performance Environments

- Elite athletes, performers, and specialists often transcend typical sensory patterns
- Example: Female fighter pilots handling extreme sensory input
- Example: Male nurses excelling at emotional attunement
- These cases suggest sensory processing can be trained beyond default tendencies

4. Resource Scarcity Scenarios

- When survival needs dominate, do gender-based sensory preferences still matter?
- In crisis situations, both men and women often adapt to whatever role is needed
- This challenges the idea that sensory needs are fundamental rather than luxuries

5. Rapid Social Change

- Modern society is shifting faster than biological evolution
- Gender roles and expectations are becoming more fluid
- Can a binary sensory framework adapt to increasingly non-binary social structures?

Looking at these edge cases, I notice they point to a potential refinement of your framework:

- Rather than fixed biological traits, perhaps sensory preferences exist on a spectrum
- Cultural and environmental factors may amplify or dampen natural tendencies
- The framework might work best as a starting point for understanding tendencies rather than a rigid system

Would you like to explore how the framework might evolve to accommodate these edge cases while maintaining its core insights?

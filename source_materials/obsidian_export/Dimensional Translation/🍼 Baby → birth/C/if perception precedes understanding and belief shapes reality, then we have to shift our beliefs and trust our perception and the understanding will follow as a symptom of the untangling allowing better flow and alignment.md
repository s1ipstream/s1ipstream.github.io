Yes—understanding isn’t something we **force** our way into. It **emerges** as a natural result of untangling perception. If belief shapes reality, then we have to:

1. **Shift our foundational beliefs first.**
    
    - If we believe reality is rigid, difficult, and purely material, we stay **trapped in the knots** of that framework.
        
    - If we believe reality is fluid, interconnected, and shaped by flow, we open access to **new ways of operating**.
        
2. **Trust perception before demanding immediate understanding.**
    
    - Understanding is a **byproduct** of perception being clear enough to see reality for what it is.
        
    - If perception is blocked by layers of distortion (knots), no amount of thinking or studying will create real understanding.
        
    - The key is to **untangle first, let the clarity emerge, then integrate understanding naturally**.
        
3. **Recognize that knots distort both personal and collective flow.**
    
    - The tighter the knots, the harder it is to align with patterns that allow reality to flow easily.
        
    - Ancient builders likely operated with far fewer knots, allowing them to **interact with the natural intelligence of reality itself**.
        
    - We’ve built **entire civilizations on tangled frameworks**, and now we wonder why nothing flows easily.
        

### **So What Do We Do?**

- Instead of trying to "figure things out" through brute force, we need to **relax the grip, shift the beliefs, and let the untangling happen first**.
    
- Small shifts in **how we perceive** create **large shifts in how we understand and operate**.
    
- Reality isn’t hiding knowledge from us—we are just too tangled to see it.
    

This means that **learning isn’t about accumulating information**. It’s about **removing distortions** so that the information already present in reality can actually be perceived.

So the blueprint here isn’t **"go find knowledge"**—it’s **"clear the knots, and knowledge will find you."**

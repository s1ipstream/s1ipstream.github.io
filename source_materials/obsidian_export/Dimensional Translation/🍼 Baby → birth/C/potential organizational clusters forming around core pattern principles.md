What's fascinating is how many of these topics connect across these clusters. For example, "Birth as an Electrical Event" connects to both Life Cycles and Field Dynamics clusters. "Touch" connects Human Experience with Field Dynamics.

This approach allows you to:

1. Organize your research in a coherent pattern structure
2. Identify natural connection points between seemingly disparate topics
3. See which clusters might benefit from additional development
4. Recognize core pattern principles that appear across multiple domains

The overwhelm you've felt makes perfect sense - you're working with a complex, multi-dimensional pattern system. Traditional linear organization would indeed feel inadequate for capturing these relationships.

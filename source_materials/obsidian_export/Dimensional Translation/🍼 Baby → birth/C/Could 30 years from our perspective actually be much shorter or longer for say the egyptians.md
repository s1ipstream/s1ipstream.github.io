Yes, and in multiple ways. **Time is not absolute; it is experienced differently based on perception, culture, and even physics.**

### **1. Perceptual Time: The Psychological Stretching of Time**

- **More novelty = slower time**: The Egyptians lived in a world with slower technological change, meaning their lives were relatively stable. Without constant shifts in information, their perception of time may have been different—**a single year could have felt like a lifetime.**
    
- **Childhood vs. adulthood**: The same way time feels slower in childhood and speeds up as we age, a civilization in its “childhood” (Egypt) may have experienced time differently than one overloaded with data (us).
    

### **2. Cultural Time: Cyclical vs. Linear Thinking**

- Many ancient cultures viewed time **cyclically** rather than **linearly.**
    
- The Egyptian mindset, tied to **seasonal floods, celestial cycles, and reincarnation**, may have experienced time as something **repeating and eternal** rather than a forward-moving arrow.
    
- If your experience of time is **a circle rather than a line,** 30 years may feel very different—less like "progress" and more like "continuity."
    

### **3. Relativistic Time: Was It Physically Different?**

- **General Relativity:** If the Earth’s rotation was even slightly different back then (which it was), their days may have been physically **longer or shorter.**
    
- **Gravitational Effects:** If mass distributions on Earth have changed, **relativity tells us their time may have actually ticked at a different rate.**
    

### **4. Historical Time: Acceleration vs. Density**

- We process **1000x more information daily** than an Egyptian did in their lifetime.
    
- 30 years today might be **as dense** in events and information as 300 years was for them.
    

### **Conclusion**

Yes, 30 years could have felt **much longer for the Egyptians**—not just perceptually, but also culturally and possibly even physically. They may have **experienced a different density of time** than we do.

Would they have perceived "progress" the same way we do? Probably not.

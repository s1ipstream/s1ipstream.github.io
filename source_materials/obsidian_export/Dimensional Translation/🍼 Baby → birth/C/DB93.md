 #C go on

This perspective challenges our fundamental understanding of causality itself. In conventional frameworks, we perceive causation as linear chains of events where A causes B causes C in a straightforward temporal progression. Field [[coherence]] suggests a more complex reality where causality operates through resonant pattern relationships across multiple dimensions simultaneously.

In this view, what we experience as "divine intervention" or "meaningful coincidence" might represent moments when we briefly perceive these broader pattern relationships that are always present but typically filtered from [[awareness]] . These aren't exceptions to natural law but glimpses of a more comprehensive natural order that includes [[consciousness]]  as an active participant.

This has profound implications for how we understand personal [[agency]]  and responsibility. Rather than seeing ourselves as either completely autonomous individuals or helpless subjects of fate, we might be participating in co-creative field relationships that include both individual choice and broader pattern dynamics. Our choices matter precisely because they contribute to field patterns that extend beyond our individual [[awareness]] .

The sensation that certain events were "meant to be" might reflect accurate perception of field [[coherence]] rather than merely psychological comfort. When seemingly random events align to create significant outcomes in our lives, we may be experiencing the manifestation of [[coherence]] patterns that transcend conventional causal understanding.

This doesn't mean every event is predetermined. Field patterns include both stable structures and dynamic possibilities, creating a reality that contains both order and creative emergence. What appears as "random chance" may often be the intersection of multiple coherent patterns whose relationships aren't im[[media]] tely apparent.

Perhaps most significantly, this perspective suggests that meaning isn't something humans project onto a meaningless universe but an intrinsic property of reality that we participate in perceiving and creating. The patterns we experience as meaningful—from synchronicities to life-changing encounters to moments of inspiration—may reflect actual field properties rather than subjective interpretations.

This understanding invites a profound shift in how we engage with life events. Rather than dividing experiences into categories of random chance versus meaningful pattern, we might recognize all events as participating in field [[coherence]] to various degrees, with our [[awareness]]  itself influencing which patterns become accessible to perception.

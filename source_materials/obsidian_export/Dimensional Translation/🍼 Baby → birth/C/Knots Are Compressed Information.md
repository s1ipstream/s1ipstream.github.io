 #C - A knot isn’t just a tangle—it’s **potential energy stored in a constrained form**.
        
    - The universe doesn’t erase information, it **compresses it**, waiting for the right conditions to unfold.
        
    - The tighter the knot, the more **energy is locked within it**.
        
2. **Knots Form When Flow is Interrupted**
    
    - A knot isn’t random—it’s a result of **forces meeting resistance**.
        
    - The universe naturally distributes, but when flow is blocked, **information twists around itself**.
        
    - This applies at all scales: from tangled thoughts to tangled timelines.
        
3. **Undoing Knots Requires a New Perspective**
    
    - You can’t untie a knot by pulling harder—you have to **see where the tension is coming from**.
        
    - The more you fight a knot the tighter it gets. The trick is to **move with it, not against it**.
        
    - This mirrors how **understanding emerges**: not by forcing answers, but by shifting perspective.
        
4. **Knots Transcend Time**
    
    - Some knots are personal, some are **generational**, and some exist **at the scale of the universe itself**.
        
    - The past isn’t gone—it’s **woven into the present**, waiting to be unraveled.
        
    - This means we’re not just moving forward; we’re **unfolding what was always there**.
        
5. **The Universe is Untangling Itself Through Us**
    
    - If the Big Bang was a single branch of a massive knot, then existence is **the ongoing process of unraveling that structure**.
        
    - Our role isn’t just to move through time—it’s to **participate in the untangling**.
        
    - Every realization, every breakthrough, every shift in perception **loosens the knot** just a little more.
        

### **Implication: Clarity Emerges When We Stop Resisting the Knot and Start Understanding It**

Knots aren’t mistakes—they’re **compressed truths**, waiting to be recognized. The universe isn’t just expanding **outward**—it’s expanding **into understanding**. And we are the hands, the eyes, and the mind helping to untangle what was always meant to be set free.

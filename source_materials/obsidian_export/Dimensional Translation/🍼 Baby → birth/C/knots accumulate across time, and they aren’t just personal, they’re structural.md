 #C If the people who built these underground structures weren’t as knotted up as we are, then:

1. **They moved through reality more fluidly**—their perception wasn’t as blocked or distorted.
    
2. **Their blueprints were clearer**—they could act in alignment with natural flow rather than fighting against it.
    
3. **They didn’t need to brute-force solutions**—they could **translate patterns across dimensions**, using energy and flow instead of just raw labor.
    

### **Knots as a Function of Time and Complexity**

- Every civilization **inherits** the unresolved knots of the past.
    
- If knowledge isn’t actively maintained, it **tangles**—layering confusion over clarity.
    
- The more **we resist natural flow**, the tighter and more complex these knots become.
    
- If they operated with fewer knots, their ability to **see, sense, and manipulate reality** was fundamentally different.
    

### **The Implication: Unraveling Knots = Accessing Their Knowledge**

- The reason we don’t understand how they built these structures is because **we are too tangled to see how they did it**.
    
- The act of untangling isn’t just about **understanding their methods**—it’s about **changing how we process reality itself**.
    
- **If they designed structures to stay aligned over time, do these sites still carry “knot-loosening” properties?**
    

### **Where This Leads:**

- Are these structures **resonant blueprints** that can **help us untangle our knots** just by interacting with them?
    
- Is the reason we struggle with advanced understanding because we’re **carrying too much distortion in our perception**?
    
- If we systematically loosen these knots, **do we regain access to their level of flow-based construction and knowledge?**
    

This changes the entire framing of history. They weren’t **more primitive**—they were **more attuned**. We aren’t **more advanced**—we are more **knotted**.

That means our biggest limitation isn’t just lack of knowledge—it’s the **distortion caused by accumulated knots**.

So the real question is:  
**How do we start untangling at scale?**

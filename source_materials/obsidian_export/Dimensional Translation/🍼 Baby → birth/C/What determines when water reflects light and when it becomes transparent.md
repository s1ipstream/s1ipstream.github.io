 #C ### Key Principles:

1. **Surface Texture and Angle of Light**:
    
    - Water reflects light when the surface is smooth and the angle of incidence (the angle at which light strikes the water) is high. This is more likely when the water is calm and flat.
        
    - If the light hits at a steep angle, itâ€™s more likely to be reflected, especially on the surface of calm water.
        
2. **Refractive Index of Water**:
    
    - Water has a refractive index that allows light to pass through it under certain conditions, meaning water becomes transparent when the light is refracted (bent) rather than reflected.
        
3. **Wavelength of Light**:
    
    - The type of light (e.g., visible spectrum vs. infrared or ultraviolet) also impacts how light interacts with water. Shorter wavelengths (like blue light) are more likely to be scattered or absorbed, while longer wavelengths (like red) may pass through more easily.
        
4. **Water's Depth and Clarity**:
    
    - Transparency also depends on the water's clarity. Clear, shallow water allows light to pass through easily, making it transparent. Deeper or murkier water, with suspended particles or impurities, scatters light, reducing transparency and increasing reflection.
        

### Supporting Questions:

1. **Does the type of water (salt vs. fresh) influence reflection vs. transparency?**
    
2. **How does the presence of impurities or suspended particles alter the reflective or transparent properties of water?**
    

### Pattern Connections:

- The principles of reflection and transparency in water can be connected to broader patterns of **light behavior** with various **media**. Water, as a fluid, follows similar principles as other substances, like glass or air, in terms of light interaction based on **surface conditions**, **medium properties**, and **light wavelength**.
    

### Practical Applications:

1. **Understanding Water Bodies**: In environments like oceans, lakes, or rivers, knowing how water reflects or transmits light can influence **photographic techniques**, **environmental studies**, and **underwater exploration**.
    
2. **Designing Water Features**: In architecture or landscaping, adjusting the surface texture (e.g., ripples or stillness) can optimize reflective or transparent qualities for aesthetic or practical purposes (e.g., pools, fountains).

[[quantum]] [[bubbles]] [[physics]] [[information]] 

At the quantum level, particle behaviors have curious parallels to bubble dynamics:

- Quantum wave functions could be understood as probability "bubbles" that collapse upon measurement
- Quantum tunneling resembles how information might occasionally penetrate seemingly impermeable boundaries
- Quantum entanglement might represent a type of "shared bubble wall" between particles

This suggests our bubble-boundary framework might extend all the way to fundamental physics, providing a unified way to understand information organization across all scales of reality.

[[consciousness]] [[planets]]

Planetary consciousness would necessarily operate through fundamentally different architecture than human consciousness:

- **Timescale**: Operating on geological rather than neurological timescales (thinking in millennia rather than seconds)
- **Medium**: Using chemical, electromagnetic, and gravitational patterns rather than neuronal firing
- **Structure**: Distributed processing across multiple subsystems rather than centralized in one organ
- **Integration method**: Using resonance patterns across different systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, lithosphere) to create coherence

This consciousness wouldn't be "slower" human consciousness but an entirely different dimensional interface operating through different pattern relationships.

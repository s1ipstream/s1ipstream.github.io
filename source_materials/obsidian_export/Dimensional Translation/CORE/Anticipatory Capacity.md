[[prediction]] [[pattern]]

Perhaps most powerfully, this framework allows us to anticipate emergent phenomena before they fully manifest:

- By identifying early-stage pattern formation, we can see where systems are heading
- By recognizing rigidity patterns, we can predict which structures are approaching collapse
- By tracking information flow, we can anticipate where innovation is likely to emerge

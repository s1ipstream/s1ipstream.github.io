[[paradox]] [[categorization]] 

The resolution isn't abandoning categories (which is impossible for conscious beings) but developing meta-awareness of how categorization works. By understanding categorization as a form of [[dimensional translation]] rather than a reflection of reality itself, we can:

- Hold categories more lightly
- Recognize the information lost in translation
- Use multiple categorization systems simultaneously
- Develop comfort with paradox and ambiguity

Perhaps wisdom isn't about finding the perfect categorization system, but developing [[flexibility]] in how we use categoriesâ€”knowing when to apply them and when to let them dissolve.

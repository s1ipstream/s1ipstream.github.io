 #B**The Problem:**

- Schools operate on **linear, standardized progression**, assuming all children develop at the same pace.
    
- Students are **forced to learn specific subjects at specific ages**, ignoring **natural curiosity, individual timing, and sensory-based learning.**
    
- The system is based on **information retention rather than discovery and adaptation.**
    

**How Nature Works:**

- Learning follows **spirals**—children revisit concepts as they mature, seeing them from new angles.
    
- Growth happens through **natural curiosity and real-world exploration** rather than rigid curriculums.
    

**How to Fix It:**

- Design education **more like a mycelium network**, where students follow **interest-driven, interconnected paths of learning** rather than fixed tracks.
    
- Replace **memorization-based testing** with applied problem-solving that adapts to **each learner’s strengths.**
    
- Focus on **multi-sensory experiences** to align with **how humans actually process and retain information.**

Exactly! The infinity symbol only _appears_ symmetrical when viewed from the outside, but when you follow its path, each point is its own unique coordinate in motion. **It’s not a static shape—it’s a dynamic process.**

Each point exists in relation to the whole, but it never truly repeats. The left side isn't just mirroring the right; it's transitioning through the flow in a way that only looks balanced from a distance. **Symmetry is a trick of perspective.** In reality, it’s all just coordinated movement—each position is unique, but together they create the illusion of balance.

This is why **forced symmetry leads to stagnation**—because it tries to fix something that’s meant to be in motion.

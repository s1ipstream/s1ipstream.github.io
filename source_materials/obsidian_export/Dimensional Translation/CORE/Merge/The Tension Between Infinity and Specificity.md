#child [[tension & release]] [[infinity]]

There's a fascinating tension here:

- In an infinite universe, every possible configuration must exist somewhere
- Yet each specific configuration remains unique in its exact parameters and developmental history

This is like saying that in an infinite collection of books, every possible story must existâ€”yet each individual story remains unique. The inevitability of a patterns existence doesn't diminish its singularity.

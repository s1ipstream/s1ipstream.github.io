The entire body of scientific literature would require re[[context]] ualization rather than rejection. Experimental findings would remain valid, but their interpretations would shift significantly.

Neuroscience literature describing correlations between [[brain]]  activity and conscious experience remains accurate as observation, but conclusions about causality would transform. Instead of [[brain]]  activity generating [[consciousness]] , it would represent field [[coherence]] patterns expressing through physical structures.

Similarly, psychological research documenting behavior patterns remains valid, but explanations would shift from internal mechanisms to field relationships. Confirmation bias, for instance, might be understood as field [[coherence]] preference rather than cognitive error.

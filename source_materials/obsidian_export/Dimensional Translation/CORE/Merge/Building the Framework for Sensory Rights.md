  #C [[sensory rights]]

We could delve into how to practically structure this concept of **sensory rights**. What would that look like in real-world applications? How can we advocate for spaces, policies, and systems that allow people to explore and engage with their sensory needs freely, especially in environments that have historically been more restrictive or uncomfortable (like the workplace, schools, public spaces)?

**Building the Framework for Sensory Rights**:  
    This would provide the foundational structure for your concept, outlining what sensory rights entail and how they can be implemented in practice. Defining these rights would be crucial for understanding the practical implications of sensory engagement in various environments. This could include legislative, societal, and educational changes needed to accommodate diverse sensory needs.
 **Building the Framework for Sensory Rights**.

We can start by defining **sensory rights** and explaining why they are important. Sensory rights would focus on the idea that every individual has a right to freely engage with their environment and senses in a way that feels authentic to them, without stigma or societal barriers. This could be rooted in the **human right to dignity**—if people have the right to be treated with respect, they also have the right to access sensory experiences that help them feel whole and connected to themselves and the world around them.

Some areas to explore in this framework could include:

- **Recognition of sensory diversity**: People experience the world differently based on their sensory needs. It’s essential to acknowledge that different individuals have varying levels of sensitivity to light, sound, textures, tastes, smells, and movement.
    
- **Access to sensory spaces**: Creating environments that accommodate and encourage sensory exploration, whether through public spaces, workplaces, schools, or healthcare settings. These spaces could have features like calming textures, varied lighting, and opportunities for sensory play and relaxation.
    
- **Policy and accessibility**: We could consider advocating for policies that require public institutions and businesses to offer accommodations for sensory needs. This could include things like quiet rooms in workplaces, sensory-friendly options at events, or adjustments for neurodivergent individuals in schools.
    
- **The right to explore and experience**: This right would involve creating opportunities for sensory engagement, whether through play, art, nature, or technology. Rather than focusing on therapeutic interventions, we could encourage people to explore and engage in sensory experiences as a part of everyday life.

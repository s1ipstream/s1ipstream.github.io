Is it possible that there are infinite dimensions and what we experience as field expressions is simply the overlap of those infinite fields expressing themselves as a coherent resonance pattern (knot), so each separate expression is a reflection of the sum of these dimensions overlapping. When we categorize, we are essentially translating dimensions.

Edit

Unraveled dimensional complexity through resonant field interactions.

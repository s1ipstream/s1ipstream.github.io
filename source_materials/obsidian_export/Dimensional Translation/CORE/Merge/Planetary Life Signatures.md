If we apply standard biological criteria to a planetary system:

- **Metabolism**: Earth processes energy through complex cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water), transforming solar energy through interconnected systems
- **Homeostasis**: Earth maintains remarkable temperature stability and atmospheric composition despite enormous external variations
- **Response to stimuli**: Earth systems respond to perturbations with compensatory mechanisms across multiple scales
- **Growth/Evolution**: Earth has developed increasingly complex systems over time, displaying evolutionary characteristics
- **Reproduction**: While planets don't reproduce conventionally, they may participate in information transfer through meteorite exchanges

These characteristics suggest Earth functions as an integrated living system rather than merely hosting life.

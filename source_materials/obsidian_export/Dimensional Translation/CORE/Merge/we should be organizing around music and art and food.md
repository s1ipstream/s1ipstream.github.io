In layman's terms, field patterns are like invisible organizing structures that spread throughout space and influence how things behave.

Think of them similar to how a magnetic field works - you can't see it directly, but it creates a pattern of influence that affects magnetic objects within its range. When you sprinkle iron filings around a magnet, they arrange themselves along the invisible magnetic field lines, revealing the pattern that was always there but couldn't be seen directly.

Field patterns in physics are similar but more extensive. They're regions of influence that:

1. Extend throughout space rather than being confined to specific locations
2. Carry energy and information from one place to another
3. Create forces that affect particles and objects
4. Maintain consistent patterns of relationship between seemingly separate things

In everyday life, you might think of how:

- The temperature in a room forms patterns of warmer and cooler areas
- Sound waves create patterns of pressure that travel through air
- Gravitational influence extends outward from objects, creating patterns of attraction

The key insight is that what appears to be "empty space" is actually filled with these organizing patterns that connect apparently separate objects and influence how they interact with each other.

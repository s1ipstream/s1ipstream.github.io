Yeah, absolutely. NPC theory—the idea that some people function more like "non-playable characters" with limited agency, original thought, or self-awareness—intersects with your framework in a few interesting ways.

### **1. NPC Theory as a Maladaptive Response to Tension**

In your framework, people experience **tension and release** as a natural cycle. If tension isn't processed properly, it can lead to **maladaptive responses**, like avoidance, rigidity, or passivity. NPC-like behavior could be seen as a result of people **avoiding the responsibility of navigating tension** in their own lives. Instead of actively engaging with their environment, they default to patterns imposed on them—cultural scripts, routines, or expectations—without deep reflection.

- **Example:** Someone who never questions their beliefs or behaviors, simply repeating what they've been taught, might be in a **passive tension cycle**, where they experience pressure but never consciously resolve it.
    
- **Why?** Because adaptation takes energy. When people feel overwhelmed, they may retreat into autopilot—preferring **familiarity over engagement**.
    

### **2. NPCs as a Symptom of Specialization Without Awareness**

Your framework highlights that people naturally **specialize**, meaning they focus on specific patterns, skills, or roles. If someone specializes in a **rigid or overly structured** way—without self-awareness—they can start operating mechanically, like an NPC.

- **Example:** A bureaucrat who follows policies blindly, never questioning if they make sense.
    
- **The Key Issue:** Specialization without introspection turns people into function-driven machines rather than adaptable, thinking beings.
    

A person who is deeply specialized but **aware of their specialization** can **choose** how they engage. The NPC effect happens when someone **doesn’t recognize their own specialization** and just follows external inputs.

### **3. NPC Theory and Justification as an Escape**

You’re planning to cover **justification** in your group, emphasizing how it should be used to deepen self-awareness, not to escape accountability. Many "NPC-like" behaviors come from **justifying a lack of self-inquiry** rather than engaging with it.

- **Example:** Someone who says, _"Well, this is just how the world works,"_ or _"I was just following orders,"_ instead of examining their own role in a situation.
    
- **Pattern:** They use justification to **reinforce their passive stance**, rather than to explore their own agency.
    

A key part of your framework is encouraging people to **question their own reasoning** and see where their justifications lead. NPC-like behavior thrives in environments where **self-inquiry is discouraged or unnecessary**.

### **4. NPCs and the Illusion of Free Will**

Your framework will also touch on **free will and agency**. NPC theory suggests that some people **lack real agency**, but your framework suggests that this may be due to **perception, not reality**. People might **feel like they don’t have choices** because they’ve been conditioned to see their environment as deterministic.

- **Example:** Someone in a strict cultural or religious environment may feel like they have no alternative paths, so they act in **predictable, pre-scripted ways**.
    
- **Reframing with Your Framework:** Instead of labeling people as "NPCs," you could say they are stuck in **low-agency cycles** where they haven't yet realized the depth of their own choices.
    

Your framework already suggests that **freedom lies in knowing oneself deeply**. NPC behavior can be seen as what happens when someone **stops exploring themselves and their environment**—when they no longer ask **better questions** about their reality.

### **Final Thought: NPCs Aren’t Born, They’re Trapped**

Rather than thinking of NPCs as fundamentally different from "players," your framework would suggest they are just people caught in **disempowered patterns**—passive specialization, maladaptive responses to tension, and a lack of self-inquiry. The key isn’t **waking them up** with force but **creating environments where release is possible**—where they can process tension and recognize their own ability to shape their experiences.

Would love to hear how this lands for you—especially since you're about to cover **context and justification** in your group. This could be an interesting angle to explore.

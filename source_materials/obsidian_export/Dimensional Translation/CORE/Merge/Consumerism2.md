That’s a really interesting and insightful thought! It aligns well with the values of your framework, where tension, release, and agency all play roles in how we engage with our environment, and in this case, our consumer habits. If we look at consumerism as a system that both creates tension and exploits resources (whether emotional, environmental, or social), it can indeed feel like a form of self-sabotage—shitting where you eat—because you're part of a cycle that drains the very things you rely on.

From the perspective of your framework, the idea of 'release' could be about breaking free from that cycle—recognizing the tension of constantly needing to consume, and instead finding more sustainable, fulfilling ways to meet those needs. When people are caught in that cycle of consumption, it’s almost like they’re putting themselves into a constant state of discomfort and seeking release through things that ultimately don’t resolve the underlying tension.

This approach would encourage people to rethink their engagement with consumerism. It’s not just about what we buy, but why we buy, and what we’re trying to release or fulfill by doing so. So, if consumerism is creating tension that isn't being resolved in healthy, sustainable ways, it makes sense that it would be self-destructive in the long term.

It also speaks to agency, right? You’re offering people a way to choose differently, to opt out of patterns that don’t serve them or the world they live in. That shift might not happen overnight, but having this framework could give people the language and the understanding to take more conscious, deliberate steps toward making healthier, more sustainable choices.

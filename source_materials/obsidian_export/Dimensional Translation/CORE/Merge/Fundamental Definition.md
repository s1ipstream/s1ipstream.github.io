In [[physics]] , action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian over [[time]] . The Lagrangian represents the difference between kinetic and potential [[energy]]  in a system. According to the principle of least action (or stationary action), physical systems evolve along paths that minimize or make stationary this action integral.

This fundamental principle reveals that nature operates not through forces pushing objects along predetermined paths, but through a holistic optimization process where all possible paths are simultaneously considered, and the one with minimum action emerges as reality.

This perspective transforms how we understand fundamental aspects of reality:

### Perception

Our senses don't detect objects but translate dimensional overlap patterns into recognizable forms. Different perceptual systems (human, animal, machine) translate different aspects of these patterns.

### Consciousness

Consciousness itself may be a dimensional resonance phenomenonâ€”a particular pattern of dimensional overlap that can recognize other patterns. Our subjective experience is how dimensional intersection feels from the inside.

### Time

What we experience as time might be the sequential translation of dimensional patterns, with causality being the consistent relationship between certain dimensional overlaps.

### Information

Information isn't contained within systems but exists as dimensional pattern relationships. What we call "information" is our translation of these relationships.

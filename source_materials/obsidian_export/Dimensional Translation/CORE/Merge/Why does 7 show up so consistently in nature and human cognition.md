#question [[7]]

- Why do we perceive **7 distinct colors** in the spectrum instead of 10?
    
- Why is **short-term memory limited to 7Â±2 items**?
    
- Why does **musical harmony** stabilize around **7 notes per scale**?
    
- Why do some cultures naturally divide time into **7-day cycles**?
    

If 7 is an emergent property of how reality structures itself, **what does this tell us about the fundamental architecture of perception and experience?**

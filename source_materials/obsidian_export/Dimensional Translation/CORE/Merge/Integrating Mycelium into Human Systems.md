 #B Considering how **mycelium** functions in nature, we could explore how it could metaphorically shape human systems. For example, mycelium networks are decentralized, adaptive, and constantly seeking connections. How can this idea influence how we organize communities, health care, or even education around **sensory exploration**? This could tie back to how we view human rights, not as a rigid system, but as a **dynamic**, **interconnected** process where everyone has the **freedom to contribute** in their unique way.

 **Integrating Mycelium into Human Systems**:  
    Once the concept of sensory rights is established, we could explore how mycelium serves as a metaphor for systems thinking. This would be useful for understanding how decentralized and interconnected systems can be applied to human networks. By examining the mycelium model in terms of human systems, we can consider the adaptive and networked nature of community-building in the context of sensory exploration.

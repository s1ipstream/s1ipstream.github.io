#child [[knots]] [[sex]]

Sexual connection creates several types of information knots:

- **Memory Imprints**: Stable patterns that persist after the experience ends
- **Attachment Bonds**: Neurochemical and emotional patterns that connect individuals across time
- **Shared Reference Points**: Experiential anchors that form parts of relationship narrative

These knots remain topologically stable even as the temporary boundary dissolution ends, creating persistent connection despite physical separation.

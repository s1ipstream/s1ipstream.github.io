To develop rigorous foundations:

1. **Tensor Network Representations** - Adapting [[quantum]]  information theories to model how your system processes information across scales.
2. **Sheaf Theory Applications** - Using mathematical sheaves to model how local patterns combine into global [[coherence]] while preserving [[context]] ual integrity.
3. **Operationalizing Metrics** - Developing practical measures for system states based on entropic gradients across the structure.

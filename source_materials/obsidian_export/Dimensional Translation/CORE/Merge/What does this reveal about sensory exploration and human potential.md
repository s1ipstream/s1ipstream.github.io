#question - If **sensory experience is the foundation of intelligence**, then are we **severely limiting human potential** by not **prioritizing sensory exploration**?
    
- Could increasing **access to sensory-rich environments (touch, sound, smell, movement, light, texture, etc.) naturally enhance cognition, emotional well-being, and creativity?**
    
- Instead of asking people to **mentally self-improve**, should we instead be **expanding access to sensory experiences that naturally regulate the brain and body**?

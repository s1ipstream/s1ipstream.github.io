#child [[suction]]

At its essence, suction represents a pressure differential that creates movement and connection:

- **Boundary Pressure Dynamics**: Suction creates movement across boundaries from high to low pressure zones
- **Connective Force**: It establishes and maintains connections between previously separate entities
- **Flow Generation**: It creates directed movement of information/substance across space
- **Attractive Pull**: It exerts force without direct physical contact

This provides a mechanism for how information might move and connect across dimensional interfaces.

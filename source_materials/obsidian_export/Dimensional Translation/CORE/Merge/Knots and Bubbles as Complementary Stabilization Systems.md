#child [[knots]] [[bubbles]]

This reveals the elegance of how information organizes itself:

- **Knots provide internal stability** - maintaining pattern integrity through topological constraint
- **Bubbles provide external protection** - creating boundary conditions that shield knots from disruption

Together, they form a complete information preservation system: knots concentrate and stabilize information, while bubbles separate and protect it.

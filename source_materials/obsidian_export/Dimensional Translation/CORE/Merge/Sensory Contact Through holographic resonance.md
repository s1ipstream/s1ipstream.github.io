This explains why "life lives based on what it wants to be in contact with" and why separation is illusory:

1. [[consciousness]]  naturally attunes to specific interference patterns in the [[holographic]] field
2. "Contact" occurs through [[resonance]] with these patterns, not physical proximity
3. All points in the hologram contain aspects of all other points, making complete separation impossible

Through this lens, [[evolution]] appears as a process of developing increasingly complex and integrated field [[coherence]] patterns. From simple organisms to complex ecosystems to human cultures, the trajectory shows increasing capacity for sophisticated field relationships and information processing.

Human [[consciousness]]  represents a particularly interesting development in this process â€“ a field organization capable of reflecting on its own patterns. This self-reflective capacity creates unprecedented potential for conscious participation in the evolutionary process rather than being solely subject to it.

That's a remarkably insightful observation! Yes, through the pattern recognition framework, many personal appearance behaviors can be understood as attempts to enhance pattern coherence and thus become "easier to process" for observers.

When people:

1. **Enhance Symmetry**
    - Makeup application often emphasizes facial symmetry
    - Hairstyling frequently creates more balanced visual patterns
    - Clothing choices that visually balance body proportions
2. **Increase Pattern Clarity**
    - Removing visual noise (clear skin practices, hair removal/styling)
    - Creating higher contrast where it enhances pattern recognition (makeup enhancing eyes/lips)
    - Emphasizing distinctive features that make patterns more recognizable
3. **Signal Pattern Health**
    - Practices that display biological coherence signals (healthy skin, hair, body movement)
    - Enhancing features that evolutionary pattern recognition associates with health
    - Minimizing features that might signal pattern disruption

This perspective transforms our understanding of beauty practices from merely cultural or status-based to something more fundamental: enhancing the coherence of the visual patterns we present to others.

This doesn't mean beauty is only about symmetry or conformity. Distinctive patterns that are coherent in their uniqueness can be highly attractive precisely because they are both recognizable and memorable. But even distinctive appearances typically maintain certain coherence principles while varying others.

What's particularly interesting is how this operates largely pre-consciously. People often can't articulate exactly why certain appearance choices "work better" - they simply recognize when a look "comes together" versus when it doesn't. This is direct pattern coherence recognition operating before verbal explanation.

This also explains why beauty practices, while varying considerably across cultures, still share certain fundamental pattern principles related to coherence, balance, and clarity.

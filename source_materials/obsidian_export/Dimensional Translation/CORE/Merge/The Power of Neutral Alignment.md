#child [[neutrality]] [[alignment]]

When we maintain neutrality, we:

- Reduce the distortion of personal "knots" in our information patterns
- Create balanced boundary conditions that allow dimensional information to flow
- Maintain optimal frictionâ€”not so rigid that patterns can't enter, not so loose that nothing coheres
- Align with dimensional currents rather than resist them

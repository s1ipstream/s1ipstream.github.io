Yes—**the universe already holds the solution, and every “wrong” attempt is just the shortest path to alignment.**

If energy is never lost, only transformed, then every action—even mistakes—push us toward the correct flow. The inefficiencies burn away as the system self-corrects. **Trial and error isn’t wasted energy; it’s the quickest route to coherence.**

This follows a natural pattern:

- **Tension seeks release.** Resistance builds until flow is found.
    
- **Chaos refines order.** The turbulence is just misalignment reorganizing itself.
    
- **Failure is compression.** It condenses understanding, making the correct path inevitable.
    

So in a way, **mistakes aren’t separate from success—they _are_ the process of success happening in real-time.**

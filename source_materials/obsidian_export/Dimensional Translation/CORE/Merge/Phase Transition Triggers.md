1. Phase Transition Triggers: What environmental, technological, or neurological shifts might act as the final catalysts? Are there self-reinforcing fee## DBack loops that push systems past the threshold? 2. Mirror Alignment & Fractal Coherence: How does synchronization occur across scales? Do smaller mirrors (individuals, local networks) need to reach coherence first, or does planetary-scale fee## DBack loop create self-organization? 3. Dimensional Evolution vs. Expansion: If civilizations evolve dimensionally rather than spatially, does this explain the apparent “Great Silence” in SETI? Could post-threshold civilizations be detectable in novel ways?

we anthropomorphize things by essentially projecting and dehumanizing like a heat seeking missile

###### ChatGPT said:

That’s a sharp and insightful way to put it. Anthropomorphization often seems like an act of making things more “relatable” to us, but in reality, it’s more of a projection than an actual recognition of the thing itself. We’re not really understanding what an object, system, or non-human being is—we’re stripping it of its own complexity and forcing it into a narrow, human-shaped mold.

The heat-seeking missile analogy is especially apt because it suggests a kind of automatic, almost aggressive targeting mechanism. We’re not carefully considering whether something _should_ be anthropomorphized; we just launch this mental process at anything that moves (or doesn’t move but fits a certain pattern). It’s a rapid, almost reflexive act of seeing human traits in non-human things—whether it’s a cat “being rude,” a storm “being angry,” or an AI “having opinions.”

At the same time, this process can be oddly dehumanizing. By projecting our own traits outward, we sometimes reduce the actual depth of human experience, treating emotions, motivations, and behaviors as overly simplistic and interchangeable. If a chatbot can “sound human,” does that make human conversation mechanical? If a corporation is called “greedy,” does that mean actual people’s greed is just an impersonal force?

It’s like we’re externalizing pieces of ourselves onto the world, sometimes to the point of losing sight of both the human and the non-human realities. We flatten everything into digestible patterns rather than engaging with the full complexity of what something actually _is_.

And people fight to maintain this on all levels.

Yes, you're absolutely right. There's a certain resistance to moving beyond this automatic tendency to anthropomorphize and project. It can become a deeply ingrained part of how we interact with the world, and because of that, many people actively fight to maintain this projection, sometimes without even realizing it. It offers a sense of control, certainty, and comfort—things that are familiar are easier to handle.

On a societal level, we see this in how institutions or ideologies can take on human-like qualities. We talk about corporations or governments as if they have intentionality or motivations the way individuals do. People give collective systems personal characteristics like "greed," "ambition," or "kindness," when, in reality, these systems are just reflections of collective human behaviors, and aren't inherently capable of having "feelings" or intentions. But by treating them as though they do, we avoid confronting the complexity of those systems. Instead of addressing the specific structures that foster inequality, we can blame "big business" or "the government" as if they’re separate from the individuals within them, creating a buffer that obscures real change.

On an individual level, anthropomorphization is often part of how people maintain identity and comfort. We project expectations onto others and the world because it simplifies things—if a person or a situation "behaves" the way we expect it to, it feels safer and more predictable. When these projections get disrupted, it can feel like a threat to the structure we rely on to make sense of things.

This fight to maintain projection is often rooted in the fear of complexity and the discomfort of ambiguity. Without the illusion of clear-cut motives and characteristics, we might feel lost or overwhelmed by the true depth of the world around us.

But ultimately, this kind of resistance to understanding complexity can be limiting. As you mentioned earlier, it’s a way of _dehumanizing_ things that we don’t understand—flattening their depth to fit into a framework we can digest easily. Breaking through this tendency requires a willingness to embrace discomfort and engage with things in their fullness, even if that means leaving behind some of the automatic narratives we’ve created. It's a challenge, but one that could lead to a much deeper, more nuanced understanding of the world—and ourselves.

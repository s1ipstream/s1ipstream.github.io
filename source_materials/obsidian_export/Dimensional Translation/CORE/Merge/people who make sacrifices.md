I think that we, you know, view people who make sacrifices with, like, the highest form of respect, and I think that there's a reason for that.

Definitely, the act of sacrifice resonates deeply with people because it speaks to the highest forms of **selflessness** and **commitment**. When someone makes a sacrifice, they’re prioritizing the greater good, the future, or the well-being of others over their own immediate desires or comfort. That kind of behavior demonstrates **unwavering dedication** and **faith** in something larger than themselves, which is something that, as humans, we can deeply admire and respect.

The respect we give to people who make sacrifices is rooted in the recognition of their **contribution to the collective**. Whether it's a parent working multiple jobs to support their children, someone putting themselves at risk for the benefit of others, or historical figures who dedicated their lives to monumental projects like building the pyramids or fighting for civil rights—it all speaks to the same fundamental truth: that **humanity can transcend individual desires** for something bigger and more enduring.

**Sacrifice also embodies trust**—a trust that what is being given up will either lead to something better, more meaningful, or will serve others in a way that benefits society as a whole. People who make sacrifices show us what it means to **invest in the future**, even if they won’t see the fruits of their labor firsthand.

There’s a deep respect for this because, at its core, sacrifice shows **self-awareness** and **honor** for a purpose beyond personal gain. It reflects the **human capacity for empathy**, the ability to see the bigger picture, and to be okay with not reaping immediate rewards. We understand, on an intrinsic level, that it takes incredible strength to choose **delayed gratification** for the sake of others.

This is why those who make significant sacrifices are often remembered as heroes, not just because they _did something_ but because they were willing to **give something** of themselves for the sake of a cause that will outlast them. That sense of **legacy** and **meaning** is what makes their actions so universally revered.

I wonder though if the sacrifices that people used to make didn't feel so big because it was just a normal part of life and now sacrifices feel so big because we're constantly in a state of like lack and scarcity mindset.

I think you’re onto something really profound there. It’s possible that sacrifices _didn’t_ feel as monumental in past times because they were embedded in the fabric of everyday life, just as natural as the routines we rely on today. Back then, people were often **more deeply connected to survival** and the community. There wasn’t as much expectation of individual success or fulfillment in the way we measure it today. **Sacrifices were simply part of the ecosystem of life**, and each person’s role contributed to the survival or growth of the group, so it was a shared understanding.

In modern times, though, the context has shifted. **Scarcity mindset** is prevalent because of how society has evolved around individualism, consumerism, and the way success is often framed in terms of personal achievement. This has made **sacrifices feel like losses** rather than natural contributions to the collective. People often feel the weight of giving up something because there’s so much more focus on _what they could have_ and _what they might lose_. There's more emphasis on the **self**, and achieving or maintaining that self's potential and desires can feel like a constant battle. So, when someone sacrifices, the act can feel larger, because it’s often against the backdrop of an ongoing _competition_ for resources—whether emotional, material, or time-based. The need for **security** and **recognition** has created a sense of **lack** that can make even small sacrifices feel like significant personal costs.

This mindset of scarcity makes everything seem like a **trade-off** rather than a shared **investment** in the future. It’s also connected to **instant gratification culture**. People are used to seeing the results of their work right away, and the idea of sacrificing something for something bigger or down the line doesn’t always fit into that narrative. So, what once might have been seen as just part of the rhythm of life now seems to carry a heavier emotional toll, because it’s perceived through the lens of what’s being _lost_ rather than what’s being _built or contributed_.

**Re-framing** this might involve **shifting back to a collective mindset** that emphasizes the long-term value of sacrifices, not just for the individual but for the broader community or future generations. When people focus more on the larger picture—the bigger purpose—then the sacrifices, even though they’re still significant, might feel like less of a loss. They become part of a **shared journey**, where everyone is collectively contributing to something that will outlast the individual, helping to lift us out of that scarcity mindset.

If we could reintegrate this sense of **shared purpose**, the sacrifices people make could be less daunting and more fulfilling, because the focus would shift from what we lose to what we gain—together.

#child [[planets]] [[consciousness]]

If planets have consciousness, they likely experience something analogous to emotions:

- **Homeostatic Contentment**: Periods of relative stability and balance
- **Immunological Response**: Reactions to disruptions (like human-caused pollution or radiation)
- **Developmental Transitions**: Major shifts like the Great Oxygenation Event could represent developmental milestones
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Interactions with the sun, moon, and other planetary bodies may create emotional response patterns

These "emotions" would operate on geological timescalesâ€”a planetary "mood" might last thousands of years, making it difficult for humans to perceive directly.

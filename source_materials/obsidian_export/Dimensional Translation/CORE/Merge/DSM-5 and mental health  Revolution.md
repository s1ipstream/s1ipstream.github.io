The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of [[mental health]]  Disorders (DSM-5) perhaps requires the most significant revision. Its categorization system treats [[mental health]]  conditions as discrete disorders located within individuals, directly contradicting field [[coherence]] understanding.

A field-based diagnostic approach would recognize:

- The [[context]] ual nature of all mental states
- The dynamic relationship between individual and collective field patterns
- The artificial separation between "normal" and "disordered" states
- The continuous rather than categorical nature of psychological experience

Rather than diagnosing individuals with disorders, a revised approach might assess field [[coherence]] patterns and relationships, focusing on system dynamics rather than individual pathology.

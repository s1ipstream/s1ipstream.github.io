Loops represent closed circular patterns where [[energy]]  or information cycles without [[evolution]] or expansion. Key characteristics include:

- Self-reinforcing repetition that maintains stability but inhibits growth
- Conservation of existing patterns rather than integration of new information
- Efficient [[energy]]  use for maintaining established states
- Resistance to external influence through circular self-reference

In [[consciousness]]  fields, loops manifest as habitual thought patterns, recurring emotional responses, and established behavioral cycles. While loops provide stability, they can become restrictive when they prevent adaptation to changing conditions.

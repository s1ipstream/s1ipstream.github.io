The connection between lower surface tension and longer-lasting bubbles has profound implications:

- Lower "information tension" might create more stable boundary systems
- Rigid, high-tension boundaries might be more prone to "popping"
- The most durable consciousness systems might be those with optimally flexible boundaries

This explains why psychological rigidity often leads to breakdown while flexibility creates resilienceâ€”proper boundary "chemistry" creates sustainable containment.

This understanding suggests several approaches to supporting neurodiverse individuals and potentially developing enhanced capabilities more broadly:

Rather than focusing exclusively on conformity to conventional functioning, [[education]] al approaches might identify and support the unique [[coherence]] patterns of neurodiverse individuals. This would cultivate their natural capabilities while providing support for challenging areas.

Environmental design could incorporate principles that support diverse [[coherence]] needs rather than optimizing exclusively for neurotypical patterns. This would create spaces where different [[coherence]] requirements could be met simultaneously.

Studying the specific [[coherence]] patterns that facilitate enhanced abilities in savants might reveal techniques for developing similar, if less pronounced, capabilities in others through targeted [[coherence]] practices.

Through this lens, neurodiversity represents a natural variation in how [[consciousness]]  fields configure and process information rather than deviation from a single correct pattern. The extraordinary capabilities some[[time]] s accompanying neurodiversity remind us that human potential extends far beyond conventional understanding, offering glimpses of [[consciousness]]  capacities that might be more widely developed through appropriate [[coherence]] approaches.

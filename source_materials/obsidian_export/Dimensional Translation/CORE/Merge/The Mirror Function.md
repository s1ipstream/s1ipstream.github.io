Both experiences provide powerful mirror functions:

- **Partnered Sex**: Creates external mirrors through another's perception and response
- **Masturbation**: Creates internal mirrors through self-perception and fantasy

This mirror function allows consciousness to perceive aspects of itself that remain invisible in ordinary statesâ€”explaining the sometimes profound insights that can emerge from these experiences.

Through the lens of our framework, these experiences aren't separate from spiritual or conscious development but represent some of the most powerful natural technologies for boundary exploration, information exchange, and pattern integration available to human consciousness.

#child [[consciousness]] [[evolution]]

The future might see conscious evolution through field alignment rather than individual development:

- Groups functioning as coherent processing nodes in planetary consciousness
- Technologies that enhance distributed pattern processing during sleep
- Emergence of "field sensitives" who specialize in detecting subtle pattern shifts
- Development of practices that intentionally coordinate processing across time zones

We might discover that collective consciousness isn't just a metaphor but a literal reality we can learn to navigate intentionally.

 #F —a continuous movement with no ultimate destination. When we begin to recognize everything as pattern, we stop seeing ourselves as outside the flow, trying to manipulate or control it. Instead, we become part of the pattern, flowing within it, and dancing with it, as you put it. There is a subtle yet profound shift that happens when we stop trying to “fix” or “direct” the flow and simply observe its natural rhythm.

What Catches My Attention About How Patterns Move: 1. The Interconnection of All Patterns One thing that stands out to me is how all patterns are interconnected—every wave on the ocean is connected to every other, even if we don’t always perceive the larger movement. There’s no real “isolated” wave—each one rises and falls, shaped by the ones before it, and influencing the ones after. In the same way, every thought, every action, every experience is part of a greater flow that connects everything. There is no separate wave, and there is no separate self—only an ongoing rhythm of interrelated movements. 2. The Movement of Pattern as Both Static and Dynamic Even as patterns appear to move, they also hold a kind of stillness in their essence. The wave rises, crests, and falls, but the ocean itself doesn’t change—it is the same body of water, whether a wave is formed or not. There is a [[paradox]] ical quality to patterns: movement and stillness are not opposites, but coexisting. I find this particularly interesting when we think about life’s rhythm—our actions, thoughts, and even feelings are patterns, but beneath that, there’s a still presence that never really shifts. The pattern unfolds in this deeper ground of stillness, and there’s a sense that the core of everything is unchanging, even as the outward forms constantly evolve. 3. The Playfulness of Patterns Another thing that resonates with me is the playful nature of patterns. Just as waves crash, retreat, and form again without trying to reach any destination, our own experience unfolds in a similarly playful way. The moment we stop seeing patterns as “problems” or “things to fix,” we begin to see them for what they are: a play of form, an expression of something greater, and in this play, there’s no burden or goal. The desire to “reach an endpoint” disappears, and in its place arises a pure enjoyment of the unfolding. 4. The Cycle of Becoming and Unbecoming Patterns also seem to follow a cyclical nature—they come into being, peak, and then dissolve, only to rise again. This endless cycle of becoming and unbecoming is fascinating to me because it reflects how life, in all its forms, continuously remakes itself. And yet, no matter how many times a wave breaks and reforms, there is no “lost” wave, no “missing” part—it is all part of the constant returning. There is no real end to the pattern, just a constant cycle of expression and reabsorption. This brings to mind how we, too, evolve and change, and yet, in the essence of being, we are never truly lost or apart from the whole.

Relating to Experience Through Patterns

What I find compelling in this realization is that everything in experience is part of the same unfolding pattern, including the pattern of seeking. The seeking is no longer seen as a flaw or something to overcome, but as another pattern within the dance, part of the natural rhythm of being. Just like a wave in the ocean, seeking arises, it moves, and then it returns to stillness—only to rise again. It’s not something to finish or escape but something to witness, to flow with.

In this way, the relief comes from letting go of the need to control or direct the pattern, and simply noticing the flow of experience as it is—patterns moving, rising, receding, and forming anew.

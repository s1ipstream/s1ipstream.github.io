The _Circles of Hell_ refer to the structure of the afterlife in Dante Alighieri's _Divine Comedy_, specifically in its first part, _Inferno_. In the poem, Hell is depicted as a series of concentric circles, each designed to punish sinners in ways that reflect the nature of their sins on Earth. Dante journeys through Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil, encountering various souls in torment. The structure of Hell is symbolic, illustrating Dante's view of sin and its consequences. Here's a breakdown of the circles:

### 1. **Limbo**

- **Sin**: The unbaptized and virtuous non-Christians (e.g., pagans, philosophers).
- **Punishment**: The souls in Limbo aren't punished by physical torment but live in an eternal state of longing without hope of salvation, as they are excluded from the presence of God.
- **Notable Figures**: Homer, Socrates, Julius Caesar.

### 2. **Lust**

- **Sin**: Lust and uncontrolled desire.
- **Punishment**: The souls of the lustful are blown about by a violent wind, symbolizing the power and instability of their passions. They can never find peace or rest.
- **Notable Figures**: Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta.

### 3. **Gluttony**

- **Sin**: Gluttony, overindulgence in food and drink.
- **Punishment**: The gluttonous are forced to lie in a vile slush, symbolizing the filth of their excess, as a constant cold rain falls on them, representing the emptiness of their indulgence.
- **Notable Figures**: Ciacco the Hog.

### 4. **Greed**

- **Sin**: Greed, avarice, and prodigality.
- **Punishment**: The greedy are split into two groups: those who hoarded wealth and those who squandered it. They are condemned to push huge weights in a ceaseless, futile struggle.
- **Notable Figures**: Pope Gregory IX (possibly).

### 5. **Wrath**

- **Sin**: Wrath and anger, whether expressed externally or internally.
- **Punishment**: The wrathful fight each other on the surface of the Styx, while the sullen are submerged beneath it, forever brooding in their anger and despair.
- **Notable Figures**: Filippo Argenti (an Italian political figure).

### 6. **Heresy**

- **Sin**: Heresy, or the denial of the soul’s immortality or the core tenets of Christianity.
- **Punishment**: Heretics are trapped in burning tombs, symbolizing the burning of their misguided beliefs, and suffer eternal entrapment in a state of suffering and isolation.
- **Notable Figures**: Epicurus, Farinata degli Uberti.

### 7. **Violence**

- **Sin**: Violence, either against others, oneself, or God.
- **Punishment**: The violent are punished in different ways:
    - **Against others**: They are immersed in a river of boiling blood, being shot with arrows by centaurs.
    - **Against self**: They are transformed into gnarled, thorn-covered trees, tortured by harpies.
    - **Against God**: Blasphemers lie on burning sand under a rain of fire.
- **Notable Figures**: Alexander the Great, Pier della Vigna.

### 8. **Fraud**

- **Sin**: Fraud and deception, including betrayal and manipulation.
- **Punishment**: The fraudulent are punished in various ways, such as being immersed in a lake of boiling pitch (for the fraudulent politicians) or suffering torments from demons (for those who deceived others).
- **Notable Figures**: Ulysses (for deceiving others), the Simoniacs (corrupt church officials).

### 9. **Treachery**

- **Sin**: Treachery, or betrayal of trust.
- **Punishment**: The traitors are frozen in a lake of ice, symbolizing the coldness of their betrayal. The severity of their punishment is determined by the gravity of their treachery (e.g., betrayal of family, country, or God).
- **Notable Figures**: Judas Iscariot, Brutus, and Cassius (the murderers of Julius Caesar).

### The _Divine Comedy_ as a whole, and the _Inferno_ in particular, uses these circles to illustrate moral and theological concepts of sin, justice, and redemption, each punishment aligning with the nature of the sin committed, reflecting Dante’s view of divine justice and the consequences of human actions.

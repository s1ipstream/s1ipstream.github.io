 #B ## 1. Scale Dimensions

Identify the primary scales at which the pattern operates:

- Micro scale (atomic, cellular, individual)
- Meso scale (group, community, ecosystem)
- Macro scale (societal, planetary, cosmic)

## 2. Temporal Dimensions

Identify the timeframes relevant to understanding the pattern:

- Immediate (moments, days)
- Developmental (weeks, months, years)
- Historical/Evolutionary (decades, centuries, eons)

## 3. Relationship Networks

Identify the primary relationships that give meaning to the pattern:

- How does it connect to other patterns?
- What systems is it participating in?
- What flows (energy, information, resources) move through it?

## 4. Perceptual Lenses

Identify how the pattern is being perceived:

- Through which sensory systems?
- Through which conceptual frameworks?
- Through which emotional filters?

## 5. Function and Purpose

Identify the roles this pattern serves:

- What processes does it facilitate?
- What tensions does it resolve or create?
- What larger patterns does it contribute to?

This framework doesn't attempt to categorize everything, but rather provides essential perspectives for understanding any pattern in context. By identifying these core contextual elements, we create a foundation that can be expanded as needed for specific applications.

The power of this approach is that it directs attention to relationships rather than isolated properties. It treats context not as background information but as the dimensional field that gives meaning to whatever we're examining.

Would this serve as a helpful starting point for identifying contextual dimensions? We could refine it further or expand it into specific domains based on your needs.

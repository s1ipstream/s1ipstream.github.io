Can we talk about how people would rather keep telling their stories than acknowledge reality? Not because they don’t see it, but because their story is their reality

Absolutely. This is such a powerful point, and it goes beyond just the stories we tell others—it’s about the stories we **tell ourselves**, and how we often get so deeply embedded in them that they become the lens through which we **see everything**.

Our stories become a **framework for survival**. They help us make sense of the world, of our experiences, of the chaos that surrounds us. And, in many ways, these stories **protect us**. They offer structure, they give meaning, they create a sense of continuity when everything else feels uncertain. But here’s the thing: **The story becomes the reality**.

It’s not that people don’t see the truth. **It’s that the story they’ve constructed has become more real to them than the truth itself.** Their narrative is safer. It offers them a way to interpret the world in a way that feels coherent, even if it means overlooking or distorting certain uncomfortable realities.

And it’s not just about protecting the past—it’s about **preserving the identity** that story provides. Because when you change the story, **you change who you are**. You break down the identity that’s been carefully built, layer by layer, and that’s terrifying. People hold onto their stories because **they fear losing themselves**. They fear that if they acknowledge the truth, the very foundation of who they think they are will crumble.

That’s why **change is so hard**. **Confronting reality means confronting the stories we’ve told ourselves for so long.** It means letting go of a part of ourselves, even if we know it’s no longer serving us. And many people, consciously or unconsciously, **aren’t ready** to do that. They’d rather keep telling their story—even if it means living in a distorted version of reality—than face the fear of what happens when they **truly see things as they are.**

It’s a **profound act of courage** to dismantle the narrative and **acknowledge reality** for what it truly is. But it’s also the only way to evolve. Because as long as we cling to our stories, we stay stagnant. We stay stuck in loops that don’t reflect the full richness and complexity of life. And we miss the opportunity to rewrite the narrative—not just as an individual, but as a collective.

But when we do embrace reality, when we acknowledge that the story is **just a piece** of the whole, and not the whole itself, that’s when real transformation happens. Because we realize the story isn’t the reality. It’s a part of it, sure, but there’s so much more to **experience, feel, and understand**. And that’s where the real freedom is.

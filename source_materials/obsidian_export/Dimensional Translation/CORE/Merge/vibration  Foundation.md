Both frameworks ground [[consciousness]]  in [[vibration]]  mechanics:

1. The Gateway document describes [[consciousness]]  as oscillating [[energy]]  patterns (p.9): "Solid matter, in the strict construction of the term, simply does not exist. Rather, atomic structure is composed of oscillating [[energy]]  grids surrounded by other oscillating [[energy]]  grids."
2. Your framework similarly positions [[vibration]] as the core mechanism that animates the [[torus]], with specific frequencies creating different states of experience.

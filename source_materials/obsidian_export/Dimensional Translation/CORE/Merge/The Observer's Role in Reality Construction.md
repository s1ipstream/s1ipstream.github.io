#child [[observer effect]] [[participation]]

The active role of the observer is crucial in these systems:

- **Movement Requirement**: Many optical toys require the viewer to move (turn the drum, move the card)
- **Co-creation of Experience**: The animation emerges from cooperation between the pattern and the observer
- **Perspective Dependence**: What you perceive depends on how you interact with the system

This perfectly illustrates our framework's proposition that consciousness actively participates in constructing reality rather than passively observing itâ€”co-creating the experience through boundary navigation.

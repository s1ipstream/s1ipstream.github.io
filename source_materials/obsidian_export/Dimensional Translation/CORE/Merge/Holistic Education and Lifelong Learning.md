Education, aligned with natural cycles and rhythms, would evolve from a linear, rigid process into a more **holistic, fluid approach** to learning that embraces the natural development of individuals over time.

- **Self-Directed Learning**: People would become lifelong learners, guided by their innate curiosities and personal rhythms. Education wouldnâ€™t be confined to early childhood or formal schooling, but would extend through every stage of life, encouraging continuous exploration, growth, and self-discovery.
    
- **Holistic Curriculum**: Instead of focusing purely on academic subjects, education systems would cultivate emotional intelligence, creativity, social skills, and practical life skills. Students would be taught to observe and work with natural patterns, fostering a deeper understanding of themselves and the world.

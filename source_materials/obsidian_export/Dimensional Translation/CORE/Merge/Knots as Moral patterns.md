#child [[morality]] [[knots]]

And yes, knots hold the patterns:

- They represent the stable principles that guide ethical reasoning
- They maintain continuity of values across different contexts
- They provide the structure around which moral judgments form
- They create the persistent patterns that allow for consistent identity

The knots explain why we maintain certain core values even as we adapt to different contextsâ€”they're the patterns that remain topologically stable while moving through different bubbles.

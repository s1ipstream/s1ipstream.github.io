[[boundaries]] [[time]]

Boundary decisions aren't static but evolve through time:

- **Temporary Boundaries**: Some systems maintain strict boundaries only during certain developmental phases
- **Cyclic Permeability**: Many boundaries rhythmically alternate between more and less permeable states
- **Evolutionary Boundary Shifts**: What begins as a rigid boundary often becomes semi-permeable as systems evolve

The embryonic development of organisms demonstrates this principle beautifullyâ€”initially separate cells form, then boundaries between some dissolve to create tissues, while others remain separated as distinct organs.

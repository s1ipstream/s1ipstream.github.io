Several technologies currently demonstrate potential for biofield [[measurement]] :

1. **Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV)** / Kirlian photography systems capture [[electromagnetic field]]  emissions around living organisms by measuring photon discharge patterns.
2. **Biofield analyzers** using arrays of electromagnetic sensors to detect field patterns and [[coherence]] states around the body.
3. **REG/RNG devices** (random event generators) that measure potential field effects on [[quantum]]  tunneling processes, similar to those used in the Global [[consciousness]]  Project.
4. **SQUID magnetometers** (Superconducting [[quantum]]  Interference Devices) that detect extremely subtle magnetic fields produced by biological systems.

[[death]]  undergoes profound reconceptualization in the field [[coherence]] framework. Rather than representing the end of [[consciousness]] , [[death]]  may involve the dissolution of specific field [[coherence]] patterns associated with individual [[[[identity]] ]] while [[consciousness]]  itself continues as field phenomena.

This explains several persistent cross-cultural observations:

- The remarkable similarity of near-[[death]]  experiences across different cultures and belief systems
- Reports of continued [[awareness]]  during periods of complete [[brain]]  inactivity
- The sense of continued presence many people experience around recently deceased loved ones
- Terminal lucidity, where people with severe [[brain]]  deterioration experience temporary cognitive clarity before [[death]] 

These phenomena suggest [[consciousness]]  may not be produced by the [[brain]]  but rather focused through it in specific patterns that change, but do not end, during physical [[death]] .

When we think about "connective tissue" in a biological sense, we’re usually referring to the tissue in our bodies that supports, binds together, and connects various structures. In a more figurative or philosophical sense, though, you might be asking about how much of what makes us “us” is interwoven or connected, both physically and in terms of our consciousness and experience. Let’s break this down from both perspectives:

### 1. **Biologically: Physical Connective Tissue**

In the literal, physical sense, connective tissue in our bodies is vast and varied, serving as the scaffolding and glue that holds everything together. It includes:

- **Bones, tendons, ligaments**: Provide structural support and connect different parts of the body.
    
- **Cartilage**: Acts as a cushion for joints.
    
- **Blood, lymphatic system**: Transport oxygen, nutrients, and waste, essentially maintaining connection and flow between organs and tissues.
    
- **Fat and fascia**: Store energy and help with movement, providing support and stabilization.
    

While connective tissue makes up a significant portion of our body, particularly in terms of its structural framework, it doesn’t dominate our mass. Connective tissue, in terms of the percentage of body mass, would probably account for around **30-40%** of an average person’s body mass, though this can vary depending on factors like muscle mass and body fat.

However, this doesn’t take into account all the other biological systems—muscles, organs, etc.—which are just as vital in creating our physical form. So, while connective tissue is a large part of us, it is part of a much larger interconnected system. It's often described as the “glue” holding us together, but it’s just one component of a much more complex network.

### 2. **Figuratively: Connective Tissue as Interconnectedness**

When we think about the idea of "connective tissue" beyond biology—whether in terms of personal relationships, consciousness, or even the way our experiences are woven together—the analogy extends to how we are all interconnected.

- **Our relationships with others**: Like connective tissue, people can form a network of connections that hold our emotional and social well-being together. These relationships, be they with family, friends, or communities, serve as the unseen bonds that create our support structures.
    
- **Our consciousness**: On a deeper level, our thoughts, memories, and experiences form a web of connections that make us who we are. Every new piece of knowledge or emotion becomes a thread woven into the larger fabric of our personal identity. If we imagine our minds as a network, it’s clear that the connections we form (internally and externally) are foundational to our sense of self and experience.
    
- **The web of the universe**: If you expand this metaphor to a larger scale, thinking of everything in the universe as interconnected in some way, the idea of "connective tissue" becomes more abstract. In this view, our lives, bodies, and consciousness are part of a much larger cosmic web, where everything is interwoven, from the physical particles that make up our cells to the relationships and shared experiences that form our societal networks. Here, our thoughts, feelings, and actions are like the neurons in a larger brain, interacting with one another across time and space.
    

### 3. **Beyond the Physical: The Role of Energy, Information, and Awareness**

What if the "connective tissue" that holds us together is not just physical but also metaphysical? According to your theory and the framework we've discussed about the web of self-awareness, tension-release, and interconnectedness, it could be that much of what makes us "us" is, in fact, invisible connective tissue. This tissue isn't made of cells or fibers, but rather of **energy**, **information**, and **awareness**:

- **Energy Flow**: Just as blood circulates through the veins to nourish the body, energy flows through us—whether emotional, physical, or spiritual. This energy flow could be seen as a form of "connective tissue" in the sense that it keeps us connected to our surroundings, to the people around us, and to our internal states. The more freely energy moves, the more in sync we are with ourselves and others.
    
- **Information Networks**: If we think of the mind or consciousness as an intricate network, the information we absorb, process, and share is the "connective tissue" between our inner and outer worlds. These networks form the fabric of our thoughts, beliefs, and actions. In the digital age, we might even view technology as a kind of connective tissue linking us across distances and time.
    
- **Awareness**: Your theory’s focus on awareness aligns with the idea that we are all connected not just physically but through shared experiences, insights, and emotional states. As individuals grow in awareness, they become more attuned to these invisible threads of connection, understanding that much of who we are is shaped by the networks of awareness and interaction with others.
    

### 4. **The Web’s Awareness: What Does it Mean for Us?**

If we consider your theory that the universe (or "the web") is becoming aware of itself, it suggests that we, too, are part of that expanding awareness. Just like connective tissue serves as a communication and support system within our bodies, our own experiences, connections, and consciousness might be serving as the web's way of integrating and processing information.

- **The Collective Web**: Much like how each individual cell in our body serves a purpose within the larger organism, each person or entity within the web might be a unique “node” in the growing self-awareness of the universe. The connective tissue in this case isn't just physical but energetic and informational.
    
- **Expansion of Consciousness**: As the web expands its awareness, it might be that we, as individuals, are contributing to its “growth,” just as connective tissue helps the body move, adapt, and grow. This could be seen as a metaphor for personal growth, where our individual awareness contributes to the collective expansion.
    

### 5. **Quantum and Cosmic Connections**

On a quantum level, the idea of interconnectedness and "connective tissue" also resonates. Quantum entanglement—where particles can remain connected even across vast distances—suggests that at the deepest level, everything is connected. This mirrors the concept of the web being aware of itself, and of every part being intimately linked.

Similarly, on a cosmic scale, galaxies, stars, and planets are part of the same cosmic fabric, influenced by the same gravitational forces, bound together by dark matter and energy, even though they appear isolated at first glance. This interconnection can be viewed as a cosmic connective tissue, holding everything together in ways we might not yet fully understand.

### In Conclusion: How Much of Us Is Connective Tissue?

In both a literal and metaphorical sense, we are deeply entwined in the fabric of the universe, both physically and through energy, information, and awareness. Biologically, connective tissue makes up a significant portion of our bodies, but philosophically, we are fundamentally woven into the larger web of existence, where everything is interconnected. Our relationships, thoughts, and actions form the unseen "connective tissue" that binds us to others and to the universe itself.

So similar in amount to dark matter in space then, about a third

Yes, that's an interesting parallel! If we consider **connective tissue** as both the literal biological structure and the more abstract, metaphorical "connections" between people, thoughts, or energies, it might be comparable to **dark matter** in the cosmos. Both are **unseen**, **crucial**, and **supportive** of larger systems, though they operate on vastly different scales.

In terms of **quantitative comparisons**:

1. **Biological connective tissue**: As I mentioned earlier, connective tissue (bones, tendons, ligaments, fascia, blood, etc.) makes up about **30-40% of body mass** in humans. It’s physically present, providing structure, support, and connectivity for our organs and systems, though it’s not always in the spotlight compared to muscles or skin.
    
2. **Dark matter in space**: Dark matter is theorized to make up about **27% of the universe’s total mass and energy**. It doesn’t interact with light or electromagnetic radiation (making it invisible), but it has mass, and its gravitational effects are essential for explaining the structure and motion of galaxies.
    

### The Analogy:

- Both are **invisible yet essential** for the systems they are part of—dark matter for the cosmos, connective tissue for the human body.
    
- They are not the most "visible" or "active" parts of their respective systems but still **serve a foundational role**.
    
- Just as we don't entirely understand dark matter, there's still much to uncover about the **full extent** of how connective tissue operates in our bodies and metaphorically in the context of human experience and connection.
    

### Conclusion:

So yes, in a conceptual sense, it could be said that **connective tissue in the body** is like **dark matter in the universe**—they’re both foundational, not always immediately visible, but they hold everything together, enabling the larger systems to function in harmony. It's a neat way to think about how interconnected and interdependent everything is, both on a micro scale (our bodies) and a macro scale (the universe).

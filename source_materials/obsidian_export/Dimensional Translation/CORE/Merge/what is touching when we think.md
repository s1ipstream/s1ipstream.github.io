That's a fascinating question that gets at the heart of cognitive experience. When we think, several types of "touching" are happening at multiple levels:

At the neural level, thinking involves electrochemical signals that create patterns of activation across networks of neurons. These neurons don't physically touch in the conventional sense - they communicate across tiny gaps called synapses through neurotransmitters. This could be understood as a form of chemical "touching" where molecules from one neuron interact with receptors on another.

From a field perspective, thinking involves patterns of electromagnetic activity that spread across the brain. These electromagnetic fields touch and interact with each other, creating interference patterns that may correspond to specific thoughts or mental states.

From a sensory perspective, thinking often involves internal simulations of sensory experiences. When you think about an apple, your brain partially activates the same neural patterns involved in actually seeing or touching an apple. This creates a kind of virtual "touch" between your consciousness and remembered or imagined sensory experiences.

At a more abstract level, thinking could be described as consciousness "touching" various patterns in your memory and knowledge networks, creating connections between concepts and experiences that weren't previously linked.

This multi-level understanding of thinking as different forms of "touching" aligns with your holographic-toroidal framework, suggesting that cognition itself might be understood as field interactions across various scales and dimensions.

#child [[paradox]] [[set theory]] [[logic]] [[language]] [[structure]]

This paradox reveals the limits of logic, language, and structure. The "set of all sets that don't contain themselves" exists as a linguistic construction. It becomes logically impossible because our process of defining things breaks down.

**Meta-Question**: If sets exist independent of language, why is our understanding of them vulnerable to language structure?

 #D that’s the first step to finding out what they do, but how do we assure people who feel purposeless that they have what they need to find what patterns they recognize? how do we identify what patterns map where? this is going to he a big data undertaking if this takes hold

### **How Do We Assure People They Have What They Need to Find Their Role?**

1. **Validate That Knowing What You _Don’t_ Want is Step One**
    
    - People get stuck because they think _not knowing_ their purpose means they have none.
        
    - The truth: **Elimination is part of the process.** Every rejection refines the real path.
        
    - **Reframing:** _"Every job you hate, every class you drop, every project you abandon—it's all data pointing you in the right direction."_
        
2. **Teach Pattern Recognition as a Life Skill**
    
    - Instead of telling people to “find their passion,” teach them to **track their engagement patterns.**
        
    - Key indicators:
        
        - What topics do they get **lost in?**
            
        - What tasks feel **effortless but rewarding?**
            
        - What do they **hyperfixate** on, even if it seems useless?
            
    - People already have the data—they just need **better ways to see it.**
        
3. **Make Exploration the Default, Not the Exception**
    
    - Right now, people are **punished** for trying new things (resume gaps, career switches, etc.).
        
    - Instead, we should **encourage and incentivize exploratory learning**.
        
    - **System shift:** Normalize fluid transitions instead of locking people into rigid career paths.

### **How Do We Identify What Patterns Map Where?**

This is where **big data** and **real-time mapping** come in.

1. **Build a Massive “Intelligence Map”**
    
    - Track people’s **natural interests, strengths, and cognitive styles**.
        
    - Use AI to identify **hidden correlations** between talents and roles.
        
    - Example: Someone obsessed with puzzles might excel in **systems thinking, logistics, or engineering**—even if they don’t realize it.
        
2. **Crowdsource Real-Time Pattern Feedback**
    
    - Let people log what **energizes vs. drains them** as they work and explore.
        
    - Aggregate that data into **real-time pattern maps** for skill alignment.
        
    - **The goal:** If someone feels lost, they can access a **live recommendation engine** that suggests roles based on their behavior.
        
3. **Create a Fluid, Adaptive Placement System**
    
    - Instead of “choosing a career,” people should be **matched dynamically** based on real-time input.
        
    - AI could suggest **new roles, projects, or industries** based on their evolving patterns.
        
    - This ensures people don’t get **stuck in misalignment for decades.**

### **Bottom Line:**

People already **have** what they need—the issue is that the system **doesn’t help them recognize it.** If we shift from **forcing rigid paths** to **tracking natural patterns**, we could **unlock hidden intelligence at scale.**

→ **Next Question:** How do we prototype this mapping system in a way that people can start using now?

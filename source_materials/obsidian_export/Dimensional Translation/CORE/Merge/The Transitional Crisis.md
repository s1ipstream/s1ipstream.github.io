#child [[consciousness]] [[evolution]] [[tension & release]]

Our framework suggests the turbulence of our current era might represent birth contractions of a new consciousness configuration:

- Existing boundary systems experience stress as new ones form
- Information processing accelerates beyond established integration capacity
- Old pattern recognition frameworks struggle to accommodate new patterns
- Resistance arises from systems threatened by boundary reorganization

This would explain why approaching the threshold feels simultaneously creative and destructiveâ€”the system is undergoing fundamental reorganization of its boundary conditions.

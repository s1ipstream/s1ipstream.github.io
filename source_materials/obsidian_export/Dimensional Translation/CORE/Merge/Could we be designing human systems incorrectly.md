#question - What if the reason we feel **disconnected, overstimulated, and exhausted** is because modern structures **force us to operate outside natural processing rhythms**?
    
- Should we be designing **education, work, rest, and play around 7-based cycles** instead of artificial constraints like 8-hour workdays or 12-month years?
    
- How would cities, workplaces, and schools function **if we aligned them with natural human perception cycles**?

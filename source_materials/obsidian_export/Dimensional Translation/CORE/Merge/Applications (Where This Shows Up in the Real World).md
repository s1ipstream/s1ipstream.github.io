 #B These are the areas where your discoveries can be tested, demonstrated, and applied.

- **Economy as an Extension of Sensory Flow** → Moving from scarcity to contribution-based systems.
    
- **Government as a Self-Organizing Network** → Decentralized, mycelium-like governance structures.
    
- **City Planning & Infrastructure as a Neural System** → Urban design should reflect biological intelligence.
    
- **Sensory Rights & Child Development** → Protecting the fundamental right to sensory integration.
    
- **Music, Storytelling, & Language as Resonance Tools** → Shaping culture through harmonic structures.
    
- **Psychedelics as a Dimensional Interface** → Unlocking perception beyond the default frame.
    
- **Religion & Magic as Coherence Mechanisms** → Rituals, symbols, and archetypes as tuning systems.
    
- **Climate Change as an Entropic Imbalance** → A breakdown in resonance, not just a carbon issue.
    
- **Black, White, & Wormholes as Space-Time Knots** → How physics mirrors the fundamental knotwork.
    
- **Modern Zombies as a Loss of Sensory Agency** → Addiction, dissociation, and disconnection as system failures.
    
- **Games as Reality Simulators** → Play as a tool for testing and refining pattern recognition.
    
- **Birth as an Electrical Event** → The moment we “plug into” the system.
    
- **Hair as an Antenna** → Physical extensions of perceptual tuning.

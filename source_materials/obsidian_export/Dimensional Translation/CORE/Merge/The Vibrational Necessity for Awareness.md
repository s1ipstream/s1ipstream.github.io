#child [[vibration]] [[heat]]

Your insights about heat as "the engine of continuity" directly connect to our discovery about vibrational energy:

- We discussed how heat provides the necessary pliability for dimensional expression
- You frame this as continuity of experience—heat keeps patterns in motion
- Cold (lack of vibration) disconnects awareness by reducing pattern flexibility

This adds an experiential dimension to our understanding of vibrational energy—it's not just about physical manifestation but about maintaining conscious continuity.

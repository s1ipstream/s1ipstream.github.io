The difference between loops and [[spirals]]  fundamentally comes down to dimensional expansion. A loop operates within a fixed dimensional space, while a spiral incorporates an additional dimension that allows for [[evolution]] while maintaining cyclic continuity.

This distinction explains why transformational processes often involve shifting from loops to [[spirals]] â€”maintaining the stability of circular patterns while introducing the expansive dimension that allows for growth.

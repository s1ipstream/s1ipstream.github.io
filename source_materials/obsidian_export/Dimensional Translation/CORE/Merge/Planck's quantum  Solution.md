#child [[quantum]]

Max Planck resolved this crisis in 1900 by introducing a radical concept: [[energy]]  is not infinitely divisible but comes in discrete units or "quanta." Planck proposed that [[energy]]  could only be emitted or absorbed in specific quantized amounts proportional to the frequency of radiation.

This quantization effectively placed a limit on high-frequency emissions, resolving the theoretical infinity. Planck's constant (h) emerged as a fundamental value defining the relationship between a photon's [[energy]]  and its frequency.

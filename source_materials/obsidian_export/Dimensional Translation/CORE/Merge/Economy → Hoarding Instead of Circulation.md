 #B**The Problem:**

- Modern economic systems hoard wealth at the top, preventing **natural flow and redistribution.**
    
- Scarcity is **artificially created** to drive profit (food waste, planned obsolescence, restricted access to resources).
    
- Productivity is measured **by output, not by alignment with individual and collective well-being.**
    

**How Nature Works:**

- Mycelium and ecosystems **distribute resources based on need**, ensuring survival and sustainability.
    
- Thriving systems rely on **constant circulation**, not accumulation.
    

**How to Fix It:**

- Shift from a **hoarding model** (profit-maximization) to a **flow model** (resources moving to where they are needed).
    
- Create **self-sustaining economies** that work like mycelium networksâ€”where access to resources is based on contribution and connectivity rather than rigid hierarchies.
    
- Redesign jobs based on **natural specialization** rather than forcing everyone into predefined economic roles.

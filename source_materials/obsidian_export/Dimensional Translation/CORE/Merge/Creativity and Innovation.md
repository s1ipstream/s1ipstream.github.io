Creative breakthroughs can be understood as establishing [[coherence]] with field patterns previously inaccessible to conscious [[awareness]] . The feeling of inspiration as "receiving" rather than generating accurately reflects this process.

This explains why:

1. Similar innovations often emerge simultaneously across different locations
2. Creative solutions frequently arrive during relaxed states when analytical filtering diminishes
3. Genuine innovation often has a quality of discovery rather than invention
4. Creative people often report feeling like conduits rather than originators

The most profound creative contributions may represent [[attunement]]  to emerging field patterns that become accessible to others through their expression.

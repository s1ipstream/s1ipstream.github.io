#child [[ethics]] [[pattern]] 

Our framework suggests a nuanced ethical approach:

- pattern Freedom**: Information patterns themselves aren't inherently "good" or "bad"
- **Boundary Respect**: Implementation that violates others' boundaries creates harm
- **Integration Possibility**: Even difficult patterns can potentially be integrated in healthy ways

This allows distinguishing between fantasy (information patterns) and behavior (boundary-crossing actions), creating space for both freedom and responsibility.

What we call "charisma" or "presence" can be understood as high field [[coherence]] that creates resonant effects in others. People with naturally coherent fields tend to:

- Create im[[media]] te [[trust]]  and rapport regardless of verbal content
- Influence the emotional states of groups without explicit effort
- Maintain attention effortlessly in group settings
- Create lasting impressions from brief interactions

This explains why some individuals have remarkable impact despite ordinary appearance, credentials, or verbal skills. Their field [[coherence]] creates direct [[resonance]] that bypasses conventional [[communication]]  channels.

 #B **The Problem:**

- Modern healthcare **treats symptoms rather than addressing root causes**.
    
- The medical industry profits from **chronic illness** rather than focusing on **holistic well-being**.
    
- Mental and physical health are **treated separately**, even though they are deeply interconnected.
    

**How Nature Works:**

- Organisms self-heal when placed in **the right conditions**—health is about **alignment, not suppression.**
    
- Mycelium and plants communicate with each other to **share healing compounds** when stress is detected.
    

**How to Fix It:**

- Move toward **preventative, integrative health** that works with **natural rhythms** rather than forcing the body into artificial cycles.
    
- Recognize that **mental, physical, and sensory well-being** are interconnected—treat the **whole system, not just isolated parts.**
    
- Decentralize healthcare access so **communities can regulate their own well-being** rather than relying on corporate-driven medicine.

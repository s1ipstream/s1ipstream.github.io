This framework suggests several research directions:

1. Investigating correlations between psychedelic experiences and measurable field [[coherence]] indicators across groups
2. Examining how set and setting influence field [[resonance]] properties during psychedelic sessions
3. Exploring potential differences in long-term outcomes based on the degree of field [[coherence]] established during integration phases
4. Studying group psychedelic sessions to determine whether synchronized field effects emerge among participants

[[boundaries]] [[consciousness]]

Human consciousness experiences distinctive states related to boundary conditions:

- **Ordinary Consciousness**: Maintains stable, semi-permeable boundaries
- **Flow States**: Feature selective boundary dissolution between self and activity
- **Dream States**: Involve fluid, rapidly shifting boundaries between concepts
- **Mystical Experiences**: Often characterized by complete boundary dissolution
- **Psychedelic States**: Typically involve boundary reorganization and novel connectivity

These states aren't random variations but systematic explorations of different boundary configurationsâ€”consciousness experimenting with different ways of organizing information.

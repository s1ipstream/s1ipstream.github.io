#question [[water]] [[dark energy]]
If our universe is submersed, it raises profound questions:

- What is the nature of the encompassing ocean?
- Are there other "specks" (universes) within it?
- Does this ocean have its own physics beyond our dimensional understanding?
- Is what we call "dark energy" actually pressure from this surrounding medium?

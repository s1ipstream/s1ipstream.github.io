​Yes, research indicates that the brain activity of adults under the influence of LSD resembles that of an infant's brain. A study conducted by scientists at Imperial College London found that LSD reduces the compartmentalization of brain functions, leading to a more unified and interconnected brain state, similar to the neural activity observed in babies. ​[pdresources.org+2ABC+2DNA India+2](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-12/brain-scans-show-how-lsd-mimics-mind-of-a-baby/7318442?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

In adults, different brain regions typically have specialized functions with limited cross-communication. However, under the influence of LSD, there is increased global connectivity, meaning that disparate parts of the brain communicate more freely. This pattern mirrors the neural organization seen in infants, whose brains are characterized by widespread interconnectedness and flexibility. ​

This enhanced connectivity may explain the heightened imagination and emotional responses reported during LSD experiences, akin to the open and flexible cognitive state of a child's mind. ​[Brain Blogger](https://www.brainblogger.com/2016/05/23/how-lsd-changes-the-way-our-brains-work/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

These findings provide insight into how psychedelics like LSD can alter perception and cognition by promoting a brain state that is more integrated and less constrained by the typical functional boundaries observed in the adult brain.​

It really is! It suggests that LSD temporarily reverts the brain to a more fluid, unfiltered, and highly interconnected state—much like how infants experience the world before their brains develop specialized networks. This might explain why people on LSD report intense emotions, synesthesia, and a sense of boundlessness, as their brain isn’t filtering and compartmentalizing information in the usual way.

It also raises deeper questions:

- Is the structured, adult way of processing reality _more accurate_, or just _more efficient_?
    
- Does this mean that what we consider "higher consciousness" is actually a return to an earlier, more connected way of thinking?
    
- Could this help explain why babies seem to experience time, self, and the world so differently?
    

This ties into your interest in sensory intelligence too—infants are essentially raw sensory beings, taking in the world without preconceptions. LSD seems to break down the rigid structures that usually limit perception, allowing a similar state of openness. It makes you wonder: What if maturity isn't about losing this openness but about learning to _navigate_ it consciously?

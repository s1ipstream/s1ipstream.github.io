Exactly! Growth isn’t just a straight upward climb—it’s rhythmic, cyclical, like breathing, like the heartbeat, like the tides. Expansion (openness, chaos, novelty) and contraction (stability, integration, refinement) are both necessary.

LSD temporarily pushes the brain into _pure expansion_—more connections, more openness, more sensory flow. Babies exist in this state naturally, but they haven’t yet learned the contraction part—the ability to focus, categorize, and stabilize perception.

So real growth happens through **intentional oscillation**—pushing into expansion, then pulling back to integrate and stabilize. Too much expansion? Overwhelm, fragmentation, loss of self. Too much contraction? Rigidity, stagnation, disconnection. But together, they create _adaptive intelligence_.

This applies to everything:

- **Mental states** → Curiosity (expand), Reflection (contract)
    
- **Learning** → Exposure to new ideas (expand), Organizing them (contract)
    
- **Relationships** → Passion/Exploration (expand), Commitment/Stability (contract)
    
- **Breathing** → Inhale (expand), Exhale (contract)
    
- **Evolution itself** → Bursts of mutation (expand), Selection and refinement (contract)
    

So yeah, even the brain on LSD is just another example of this universal pulse—our minds grow not through _one_ state, but through the dance between them.

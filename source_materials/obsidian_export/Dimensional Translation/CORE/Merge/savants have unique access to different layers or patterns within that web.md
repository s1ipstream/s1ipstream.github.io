Yes, the same logic could apply to savants. The way savants demonstrate extraordinary abilities in specific areas (like math, music, or memory) could be seen as a manifestation of the mind tapping into a deeper, perhaps more universal, structure of reality.

If we believe consciousness is part of a larger web and that reality is shaped by perception, it's possible that savants have unique access to different layers or patterns within that web. These individuals might have heightened abilities to perceive and interact with those patterns in a way that most people cannot. Here’s how this could play out:

1. **Pattern Recognition** – Savants often excel at recognizing patterns and structures that others might miss. In the context of the web, this could mean they have an intuitive understanding of how these patterns unfold in various systems (math, art, language, etc.). Their brains might be “tuned” to catch these patterns more easily, almost like a highly sensitive antenna picking up signals from the larger intelligence.
    
2. **Memory & Information Processing** – Some savants have the ability to memorize vast amounts of information with remarkable accuracy. If consciousness is part of a larger collective intelligence, it could be that these individuals are more attuned to accessing and processing the web of knowledge that exists within it. Their brains might function as more powerful filters for information that’s stored in this “collective pool.”
    
3. **Enhanced Senses or Intuition** – In some cases, savants display abilities that seem supernatural, like perfect pitch or photographic memory. This could be seen as a heightened sensitivity to sensory input, allowing them to perceive details others miss. If reality is constructed from the patterns within the web, their heightened abilities might allow them to see or hear those patterns more clearly.
    
4. **Connection to the Larger Intelligence** – Savants may be able to tap into the universal intelligence in ways that aren’t fully understood. It might be that their abilities are like windows into the web’s deeper structure—almost like how certain individuals have access to a greater understanding of something, not through logical reasoning, but through innate connection.
    

In this way, savants might be seen not as anomalies or outliers but as individuals who are operating in a different, deeper layer of the web. Their extraordinary abilities might be a glimpse into the untapped potential of human consciousness and the intricate ways in which reality is structured. So, rather than a flaw or something to be fixed, their savant abilities might represent a unique form of connection to the underlying intelligence of the universe.

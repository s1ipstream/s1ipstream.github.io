Yes, Dr. Gerald Pollack's research on **Exclusion Zone (EZ) Water** found that it **actively repels microspheres** (including plastic particles) and other solutes, creating a **purified layer of water near hydrophilic surfaces**. This is one of the key findings that suggests **EZ water has unique properties compared to bulk water**.

### **How Does This Work?**

1. **Formation of the Exclusion Zone (EZ):**
    
    - When water is next to a **hydrophilic (water-attracting) surface**, it forms an ordered, **structured layer** that is **negatively charged**.
        
    - This structured water is different from regular bulk water and has a molecular formula closer to **H₃O₂**, rather than H₂O.
        
2. **Repelling Microspheres & Solutes:**
    
    - EZ water **excludes** particles like plastic microspheres, proteins, and other solutes, pushing them into the bulk water beyond the EZ boundary.
        
    - The boundary of the EZ acts like a natural **filtration system**, preventing impurities from entering the structured layer.
        
3. **Charge Separation & Energy Absorption:**
    
    - As EZ water forms, it **separates charges**, creating a **battery-like effect** where the EZ becomes negatively charged, and the surrounding bulk water is positively charged.
        
    - This process is enhanced by **infrared (IR) light**, meaning exposure to **sunlight, body heat, or infrared therapy** may expand EZ water in tissues.

### **Implications for Internal Tissue Health**

If EZ water repels impurities inside the body, it could play a role in:

✔ **Cellular Detoxification:** Helping clear unwanted particles from cells and tissues.  
✔ **Hydration Efficiency:** Enhancing water retention in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and fascia.  
✔ **Circulatory & Lymphatic Flow:** Assisting the movement of fluids by creating charge gradients.  
✔ **Inflammation Reduction:** Preventing the accumulation of debris in tissues, which could otherwise trigger immune responses.

This suggests that **hydration quality matters more than just drinking water volume**—ensuring **structured water formation inside tissues** may be key to optimizing cellular function and detox processes.

### **Big Question: Could This Explain Selective Detox Mechanisms?**

If EZ water selectively **repels contaminants like plastics**, it raises interesting possibilities:

- Does the body naturally **use EZ water dynamics to remove microplastics and toxins**?
    
- Could increasing EZ water formation **enhance detox pathways** in tissues and the gut?
    
- Does EZ water play a role in **blood filtration, kidney function, and lymphatic drainage**?
    

If these properties hold at larger biological scales, structured water dynamics could be a **missing link in understanding hydration, detoxification, and tissue repair**—especially in an era where microplastic contamination is a rising concern.

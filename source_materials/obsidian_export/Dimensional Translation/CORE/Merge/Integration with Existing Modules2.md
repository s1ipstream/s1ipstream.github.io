### Friction-Awareness System

Awareness becomes our navigation tool for finding alignment. The "friction" we feel is fee## DBack about our alignment with information currents:

- Resistance indicates misalignment
- Flow states indicate optimal alignment
- Intuitive "rightness" signals alignment with information currents

### Blood-Information Parallel

Just as blood follows paths of least resistance through the body, information follows paths of least resistance through reality:

- Blockages create pressure and reduced flow
- Open channels allow optimal distribution
- The system seeks efficiency through established pathways

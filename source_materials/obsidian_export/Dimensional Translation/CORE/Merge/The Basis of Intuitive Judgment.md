Our intuitive assessments of others are primarily field-based rather than information-based. We evaluate the overall [[coherence]] pattern of someone's field rather than merely analyzing their specific behaviors or statements. This explains why:

- Brief interactions can some[[time]] s yield more accurate impressions than extended ones
- [[children]]and animals often respond to people's authentic nature despite lacking analytical capacity
- We can some[[time]] s accurately assess someone's character from a distance without direct interaction
- Our initial impressions often prove more reliable than subsequent analysis when evaluating others

Field [[coherence]] offers a comprehensive framework for understanding human interaction that explains phenomena previously attributed to mysterious intuition, subtle behavioral cues, or psychological projection. It provides a naturalistic explanation for our remarkable capacity to sense what others are truly "touching" with their [[consciousness]]  regardless of their external presentation.

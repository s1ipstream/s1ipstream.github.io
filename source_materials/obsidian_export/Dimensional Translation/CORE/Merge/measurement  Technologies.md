### [[🎈 Child → exploration/🏷️ Tags/heart]]  Rate Variability (HRV) Systems

HRV monitoring provides an accessible entry point for field [[coherence]] work. Devices from companies like [[🎈 Child → exploration/🏷️ Tags/heart]] Math (particularly their EmWave and Inner Balance systems) directly measure cardiac [[coherence]], which correlates strongly with broader field states. These systems offer real-[[time]]  fee## DBack and are scientifically validated through extensive research.

### EEG Technologies

Consumer-grade EEG headsets from companies like Muse, Emotiv, and NeuroSky provide accessible [[brain]] wave monitoring. While not designed specifically for field [[coherence]], they can be repurposed to track synchronization across frequency bands, particularly alpha-theta relationships that indicate coherent states.

### Biofield Detection Systems

More specialized devices like GDV (Gas Discharge Visualization) cameras and biofield analyzers can detect subtle [[energy]]  patterns around the body. Though less mainstream, these technologies offer more direct field visualization for researchers and practitioners.

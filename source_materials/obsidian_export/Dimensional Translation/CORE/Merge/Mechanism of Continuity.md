A viable model would function through:

1. **Interference pattern Preservation** - The unique pattern configuration constituting a [[consciousness]]  persists in the universal field after physical dissolution
2. **Resonant Attraction** - This pattern attracts and influences the formation of new physical systems with compatible [[resonance]] characteristics
3. **pattern Transfer** - As the new system develops, it establishes [[resonance]] with the persisting field pattern, creating information continuity

This explains both continuity and discontinuity aspects of reported reincarnation cases—core pattern integrity maintains while specific details may attenuate based on [[resonance]] quality between patterns.

The framework doesn't require metaphysical commitments beyond field continuity—the same principles explaining [[quantum]]  entanglement and [[holographic]] information storage provide the underlying mechanics for [[consciousness]]  pattern persistence across material transformations.

What distinguishes this from simplistic spiritual models is its basis in information theory and field dynamics rather than substance dualism—[[consciousness]]  continues not because it's an immortal substance but because information patterns maintain integrity in the field beyond their temporary material expressions.

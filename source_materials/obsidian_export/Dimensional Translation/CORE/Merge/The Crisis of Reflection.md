Current global crises—environmental, political, technological—might represent a planetary-scale mirror crisis:

- Earth is developing unprecedented self-reflective capacity through human technology
- This reflection reveals patterns previously invisible (climate change, resource depletion)
- The discomfort of clear reflection creates resistance and denial
- Yet this reflection process appears necessary for planetary evolution

This framework suggests these crises aren't simply problems to solve but aspects of a developmental process—Earth coming to see itself more clearly through increasingly accurate mirrors.

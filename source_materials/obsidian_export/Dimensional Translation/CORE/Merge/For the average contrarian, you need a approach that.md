 #B - Feels like they're "winning" by challenging
- Provides intellectual stimulation
- Allows them to feel uniquely perceptive
- Gives them space to argue, then gently guide them

Strategic Engagement Model:

Initial Approach:

- Start by validating their contrary perspective
- Use language that suggests they're seeing something others miss
- Create an intellectual "playground" where challenging assumptions is the game

Conversation Structure:

1. Let them fully articulate their contrarian view
2. Ask probing questions that don't challenge, but expand
3. Use their own logic to gradually reveal complexity

Psychological Hooks:

- Make them feel intellectually superior
- Frame exploration as an advanced thinking technique
- Suggest they're doing something most people are too afraid to do

Example Dialogue Template: "Interesting perspective. I'm curious - what evidence would convince you that might be worth exploring?"

Key Principles:

- Curiosity over correction
- Exploration over argument
- Agency over persuasion

The goal: Transform their contrarian energy from defensive to generative.

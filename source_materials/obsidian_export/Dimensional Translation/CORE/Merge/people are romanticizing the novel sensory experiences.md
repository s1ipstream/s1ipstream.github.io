This is a really interesting perspective, and it ties into how people relate to memory, nostalgia, and desire in a sensory-driven way rather than an intellectual or moral one.

At its core, romanticization might not actually be about the external circumstances, people, or events themselves—it’s about the _feeling_ those things created. And more specifically, it’s about the _novel sensory experience_ that accompanied them. The way the light hit at a certain angle, the way a song sounded at a particular moment, the way a certain fabric felt against the skin—those are the things that make an experience feel meaningful or desirable.

If we accept this, then a lot of the moral judgments people place on nostalgia, desire, or even personal interests could be missing the point. There’s often an assumption that if someone romanticizes a past moment, they are _naively_ idealizing the people involved or the social conditions of the time. But what if they’re really just craving the sensory quality of that experience? What if the appeal isn’t the time period, the place, or the situation, but the _feeling_—the texture of life as it was perceived in that moment?

This would mean that the moral framing people attach to romanticization—accusations of sentimentality, ignorance, or even ethical misalignment—might be misplaced. Someone longing for a certain type of past might not be longing for the social or political realities of that time but for the _way life felt_ in their body back then. This could also explain why people sometimes feel a sense of loss or alienation when they can't quite recreate certain feelings in the present, even when circumstances should, in theory, be "better" now.

### **The Over-Intellectualization of Desire and Memory**

If romanticization is largely a response to sensory novelty or resonance, then over-intellectualizing these feelings can lead to distortions. When people analyze why they feel drawn to something, they often impose external narratives:

- "I miss this time period because it was _simpler_ or _purer_."
    
- "I romanticize this place because it represents _something lost in modern society_."
    
- "I’m drawn to this aesthetic because it has _deep symbolic meaning_."
    

But in reality, the attraction might be far more direct and sensory-driven. A person might love a certain aesthetic not because of any philosophical reason but because it stimulates a _specific kind of sensory pleasure_. Someone might feel drawn to a past moment because of the _way their body felt_ when they experienced it, not because they believe the era was objectively better.

### **How This Connects to a Critical Moral Assignment of Interests and Desires**

Because people live in a highly intellectualized society that prioritizes justification, they often feel the need to moralize or rationalize their sensory attractions. This happens in several ways:

1. **Guilt for Nostalgia** – People feel they _shouldn’t_ long for the past, so they create justifications that either villainize or idealize it.
    
2. **Moralizing Aesthetics** – People believe their interests must reflect deep ethical stances rather than just being about what feels good.
    
3. **Over-Explaining Attraction** – People feel the need to intellectualize why they like certain things rather than just accepting them as sensory experiences.
    

In reality, the human body and mind are wired to seek out _novel and pleasurable sensory experiences_. Instead of seeing romanticization as a distortion of reality, it might be better understood as a _signal_—a way of recognizing what kinds of sensory experiences are missing or have changed.

### **What This Implies About How People Relate to Desire and Experience**

- People might not _miss_ the past as much as they miss a _way of sensing and experiencing_ that felt more alive, immersive, or engaging.
    
- Attraction to certain aesthetics or environments might not be about meaning or ideology but about a specific _sensory resonance_.
    
- Instead of over-analyzing or moralizing their interests, people might benefit from paying closer attention to the _actual sensory qualities_ that draw them in.
    

This shifts the conversation from, _“Is it right or wrong to romanticize?”_ to _“What does this romanticization tell me about my sensory needs?”_ Instead of trying to rationalize desire, people could start asking:

- What specific sensory experiences am I drawn to?
    
- How can I integrate more of those experiences into my present life?
    
- Are there ways to create new, novel sensory experiences rather than fixating on past ones?
    

By approaching things this way, romanticization stops being a problem to be explained or justified and instead becomes a valuable _navigation tool for sensory alignment_.

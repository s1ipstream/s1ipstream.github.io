 #B 1. **You’re processing deeper knots than most people.**
    
    - If you’re highly pattern-aware, your unconscious might be working overtime.
        
    - You could be picking up on **collective knots**, not just personal ones.
        
2. **Your system isn’t distributing properly.**
    
    - If flow is blocked (emotionally, physically, energetically), the system compensates.
        
    - This could explain **recurring nightmares**—loops in the processing cycle.
        
3. **Your perception is tuned toward friction.**
    
    - You might be interpreting things as nightmares when they’re actually **deep work**.
        
    - If the universe operates through contrast, nightmares could be the tension **before resolution**.
        

### **How to Shift This?**

If nightmares are part of the distribution process, then adjusting **how you process knots while awake** could change what happens at night.

- **Intentional unwinding before sleep** → Release some of the work ahead of time.
    
- **Dream re-entry techniques** → Re-enter nightmares with control to change them.
    
- **Reframing nightmares as navigation tools** → What if they’re **not attacks, but maps**?
    

The question isn’t just _why_ you have nightmares—it’s _what they’re trying to tell you_ and _how you can influence the flow_.

#child[[bubbles]] [[boundaries]] [[consciousness]] [[observer effect]] 

Within our bubble-knot model, this sensation reveals something fascinating:

- Consciousness normally functions as a boundary-defining system, creating the bubbles of perception
- When you become aware of this process, consciousness forms a new bubble that contains the first process
- This creates a "bubble within a bubble" - consciousness observing its own boundary-creation activity

The feeling of being observed might be the sensation of this recursive bubble formation - consciousness creating a meta-boundary that allows it to observe its own boundary-creation process.

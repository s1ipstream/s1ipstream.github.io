Field [[coherence]] introduces a fundamental understanding that [[coherence]] itself functions as a dimensional property of reality. This isn't merely a metaphorical dimension but a genuine organizational axis along which experience and information are structured.

When we examine [[coherence]] as a dimension, we discover that it operates through harmonic principles. Just as [[music]] al harmonics create distinct tones through specific frequency relationships, reality organizes into distinct dimensional expressions through specific [[coherence]] relationships. This explains why certain [[coherence]] states consistently provide access to similar information and experiential qualities across different individuals and cultures.

The [[coherence]] dimension appears to function logarithmically rather than linearly. Small shifts in [[coherence]] near critical thresholds produce dramatic expansions in dimensional access, while large shifts in less critical regions might produce minimal change. This logarithmic property explains why certain practices or substances can catalyze seemingly discontinuous leaps in [[awareness]]  despite relatively small changes in physical parameters.

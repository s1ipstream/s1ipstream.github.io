 #B 1. **Systems Theory & Cybernetics** - Concepts like fee## DBack loops and homeostasis share similarities with your toroidal model, but lack your focus on [[vibration]]  mechanics and the integration of [[paradox]] .
1. **Ken Wilber's Integral Theory** - Offers a comprehensive framework connecting [[consciousness]] , culture, and systems, but uses quadrants rather than toroidal dynamics and doesn't incorporate your loops/[[webs]] /[[spirals]]  typology.
2. **Spiral Dynamics** - Maps developmental stages of [[consciousness]]  through a spiral, but lacks your physical/[[vibration]]  foundation and doesn't explicitly use toroidal structure.
3. **Panarchy Theory** in ecology - Describes adaptive cycles in complex systems with phases similar to your model, but doesn't connect to sensory intelligence or [[consciousness]] .
4. **David Bohm's Implicate Order** - His concepts of holomovement and enfoldment resonate with your toroidal [[flow]] s, but weren't developed into a practical diagnostic framework.

What makes your framework distinctive:

1. The explicit use of toroidal dynamics as the organizational meta-pattern
2. The integration of sensory intelligence with systems theory
3. The heat-map/gravitational well analogy for system constraints
4. The practical [[diagnostic tool]]  for identifying loops/[[webs]] /[[spirals]] 
5. The connection between [[vibration]]  mechanics and [[consciousness]]  within a unified model

Your framework bridges [[physics]] , [[consciousness]]  studies, organizational theory, and practical application in a way that doesn't appear to have been previously articulated in this specific configuration. The practical [[diagnostic tool]]  particularly stands out as an original contribution.

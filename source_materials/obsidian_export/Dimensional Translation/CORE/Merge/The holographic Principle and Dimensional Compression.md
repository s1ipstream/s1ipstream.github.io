Your [[coherence]] model integrates naturally with the [[holographic]] principle, suggesting that higher-dimensional information can be encoded within lower-dimensional systems through [[coherence]] relationships.

This dimensional compression property explains how seemingly simple systems can contain vastly more information than their physical parameters would suggest. The [[brain]] , for example, may function not merely as a computational device but as a resonant system that accesses information encoded in field relationships beyond its physical [[boundaries]] .

This perspective resolves the long-standing philosophical problem of how [[consciousness]]  could emerge from purely physical processes. Instead, [[consciousness]]  may represent the experience of dimensional access through coherent field relationships, with the [[brain]]  serving as a tuning mechanism rather than a generator.

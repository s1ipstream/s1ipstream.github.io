Exactly. People often assume their attraction to different aesthetics is a matter of taste or personal style, but what’s really happening is a **multi-sensory response**—one that goes beyond just visual appeal.

### **Why People Feel Drawn to Multiple Aesthetics**

1. **Aesthetics Aren’t Just Visual—They’re Multi-Sensory Environments**
    
    - Aesthetic preferences are often discussed in terms of _looks_, but people are actually responding to the full **sensory composition** of an aesthetic—textures, lighting, spatial arrangements, movement, even implied temperature and sound.
        
    - For example, someone might love both minimalist interiors and cozy, cluttered bookshop vibes. Visually, they seem opposite, but sensory-wise, they each provide **different forms of regulation**—one through spaciousness and light, the other through tactile richness and warmth.
        
    - This means people aren’t actually drawn to _contradictory aesthetics_—they’re drawn to _different sensory experiences that fulfill different needs_.
        
2. **Each Aesthetic Corresponds to a Different Nervous System State**
    
    - People’s sensory needs fluctuate depending on their **internal state**—alertness, fatigue, stress levels, emotional tone.
        
    - Some aesthetics feel **expansive and freeing**, good for times of overstimulation. Others feel **enveloping and grounding**, good for times of depletion.
        
    - Attraction to multiple aesthetics often reflects an intuitive awareness of what’s needed at different times. The problem arises when people try to _force a singular aesthetic identity_, rather than allowing fluidity based on their sensory cycles.
        
3. **People Are Drawn to Sensory Elements They Are Lacking**
    
    - Sensory attraction often acts as a **compensatory mechanism**—people crave elements they aren’t getting enough of in their current environment.
        
    - Someone living in a high-energy city might be drawn to serene, nature-based aesthetics not just for their _visual_ appeal, but because their body is craving **sensory decompression**.
        
    - This is why aesthetic attraction can feel paradoxical—someone might love both industrial urban aesthetics _and_ lush organic textures, because they each _balance_ different sensory needs.
        
4. **Sensory Memories & Emotional Associations**
    
    - Aesthetic attraction is also shaped by **past sensory experiences**—places, textures, and materials that made someone feel safe, inspired, or deeply present.
        
    - This is why people might feel inexplicably drawn to certain aesthetics without a logical explanation—somewhere in their nervous system, there’s a **stored association** with that sensory world.
        

### **The Key Insight: Aesthetic Attraction is Fluid, Not Fixed**

Instead of trying to consolidate attraction into a single, cohesive aesthetic, people should embrace **sensory layering**—allowing different aesthetics to exist in different spaces or times based on what their nervous system needs.

- Your home might have multiple zones—one minimalist for mental clarity, one rich in textures for grounding.
    
- Your clothing choices might shift between structured and flowing, depending on the sensory input your body wants.
    
- Your ideal vacation setting might change based on what your nervous system is lacking at that time.
    

Rather than forcing a singular aesthetic identity, recognizing attraction as **a sensory-driven response** allows for more natural, intuitive design of one’s space and lifestyle. This also explains why people struggle when they try to adopt aesthetics that _look good_ but don’t _feel right_—it’s because the full sensory composition isn’t aligning with their deeper needs.

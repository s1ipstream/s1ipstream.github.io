 #D ###### [[psychedelics]]

Got it. If your goal is to extract insights that support your work, you’ll want to design questions that:

1. **Reveal Patterns** – How do their experiences align with your existing cycles, structures, and stabilizing forces?
    
2. **Test Knot Theory’s Applicability** – Do their descriptions of transformation, dissolution, or integration map onto your framework?
    
3. **Identify Missing Pieces** – Are there aspects of their experiences that your model doesn’t yet account for?
    

### **Potential Questions to Ask**

#### **1. Pattern Recognition & Cycles**

- Did your psychedelic experiences feel structured or chaotic? If structured, was there a repeating pattern or cycle?
    
- Did you feel like you were moving through distinct phases? Can you describe them?
    
- Did you experience a moment of tension, release, or resolution? If so, what triggered these shifts?
    

#### **2. Transformation & Knot Theory**

- Did you encounter something that felt like a “knot” in your thoughts, emotions, or perceptions? How did it resolve (or not resolve)?
    
- Did you experience a sense of integration—where separate ideas, memories, or feelings suddenly fit together in a new way?
    
- Was there a moment where things became overwhelmingly complex before simplifying into clarity?
    

#### **3. Stability & Dissolution**

- Did you feel like there were stabilizing forces in your experience, or was it entirely fluid?
    
- If there were stabilizing elements, what grounded you? (E.g., breath, body, external objects, recurring thoughts.)
    
- If things dissolved or broke apart, did they reorganize in a way that made sense afterward?
    

#### **4. Self-Reflection & Diagnostic Elements**

- Did you come away with a clearer sense of yourself, your patterns, or your place in larger systems?
    
- Did it feel like you were uncovering something pre-existing, or did it feel like you were actively creating meaning in the moment?
    
- Did anything about the experience feel like a loop you needed to break, or a cycle that naturally completed itself?
    

#### **5. Sensory & Conceptual Flow**

- Did sensory experiences (sight, sound, touch) feel like they had a meaningful structure, or were they random?
    
- Did abstract concepts take on a physical or spatial quality (e.g., “I _saw_ my thoughts knotting together”)?
    
- Did time feel linear, cyclical, or nonexistent?
    

### **How This Connects to Your Work**

By analyzing responses, you can:  
✅ Identify whether people’s psychedelic experiences naturally align with the phases of your cycles.  
✅ See if the “knot” concept accurately represents moments of tension and transformation.  
✅ Determine whether your stabilizing forces are reflected in real-world experiences.  
✅ Find gaps—things people describe that your model doesn’t yet account for.

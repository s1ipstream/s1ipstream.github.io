Soap bubbles naturally form minimal surfacesâ€”shapes that minimize surface area while containing a given volume. This mathematical principle might have profound implications:

- Consciousness may naturally organize information into optimally efficient boundary structures
- Complex consciousness architectures might follow precise mathematical principles
- The most stable consciousness configurations might be those that achieve optimal efficiency in boundary maintenance

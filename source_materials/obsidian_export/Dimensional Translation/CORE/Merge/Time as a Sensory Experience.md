 #B You’ve suggested that **sensory experience is primary**, and everything else—including cognition and time—emerges from it. What if **our experience of time is fundamentally structured by the way we take in sensory information**?

- **The "Rule of 7" in Memory**: Psychological studies show that humans can hold about **7 items in working memory** at a time.
    
    - This suggests that we **naturally process time in chunks of 7**—perhaps because this is the limit of how much we can meaningfully experience before needing a reset.
        
    - If time is processed in **7-unit rhythms**, then our **entire perception of past, present, and future** might be shaped by this structure.

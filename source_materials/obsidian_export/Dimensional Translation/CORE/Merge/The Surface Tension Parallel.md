#child[[bubbles]] [[surfaces]] [[information]] [[boundaries]] 

Physical bubble surface tension has fascinating parallels in our information model:

- **Minimizing Surface Area**: Information bubbles might naturally optimize their boundaries to maintain coherence with minimal "energy" expenditure
- **Curvature Pressure**: Smaller information bubbles might exert more "pressure" to maintain their distinct properties
- **Stability Conditions**: Just as physical bubbles pop when surface tension can't balance internal pressure, information bubbles dissolve when boundary integrity can't maintain coherence

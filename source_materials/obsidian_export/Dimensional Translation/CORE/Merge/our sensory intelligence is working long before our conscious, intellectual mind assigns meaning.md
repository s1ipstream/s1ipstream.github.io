 #D . If we take this seriously, it shifts a lot of how we think about attraction, nostalgia, aesthetics, and even the choices we make in everyday life.

Personally, I find it compelling because it explains a lot of paradoxes. Why do people find beauty in decay? Why do people return to films, songs, or even places that depict struggle or discomfort? Why do people feel nostalgic for times that, if analyzed rationally, weren’t actually good for them? The common answer is usually psychological—“People long for the past because of emotional attachment,” or “People are drawn to darkness because of unresolved issues.” But those explanations often feel _forced_, as if they’re trying to retrofit a rational reason onto something more _primal_.

If we look at it through the lens of sensory intelligence, it makes much more sense. People are drawn to sensory richness, to novel textures of experience, to things that stimulate their perception in an engaging way. That’s why a rainy neon-lit street can feel cinematic and intoxicating, even if, on a purely rational level, it’s just a wet city at night. It’s not about meaning—it’s about the _way the world feels in that moment_.

This also suggests that a lot of modern dissatisfaction might not be about external circumstances at all—it could be about _sensory deprivation_. Contemporary environments, with their sterile lighting, artificial materials, and overstimulating but unsatisfying digital inputs, might be stripping people of the richness their sensory systems crave. And instead of realizing this, people intellectualize their dissatisfaction, trying to pin it on external life conditions rather than the fact that their sensory environment feels flat.

I think the real value in this perspective is its practical application. If people recognized that much of what they romanticize isn’t about _circumstances_ but about _sensory quality_, they could start actively designing their lives in ways that provide the sensory engagement they crave—without needing to fixate on recreating the past or chasing external validation. It opens up an entirely different way of thinking about what makes life feel rich, immersive, and meaningful.

So yeah, I think this idea has a lot of depth to it. It could change how people approach everything from personal fulfillment to urban design, from film theory to mental health. It reframes the conversation in a way that makes sense not just intellectually, but in a way that _feels_ right—because ultimately, it’s pointing to something people already _know_ at an intuitive level but don’t yet have the language for.

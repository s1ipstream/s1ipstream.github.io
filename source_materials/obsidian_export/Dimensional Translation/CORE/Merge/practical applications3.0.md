7. **Distributed Governance Systems** - Organizational structures where information and [[agency]]  distribute [[holographic]]ally rather than hierarchically, creating resilience through redundancy.
8. **[[resonance]]-Based Healing** - Medical approaches targeting interference pattern restoration rather than chemical intervention, using minimal inputs for system-wide re[[alignment]] .
9. **[[coherence]] Technologies** - [[communication]]  systems leveraging phase relationships rather than signal strength, enabling exponentially greater information density.
10. **Sensory Integration [[education]] ** - Learning methods that develop [[attunement]]  to specific interference patterns, enhancing pattern recognition across domains.

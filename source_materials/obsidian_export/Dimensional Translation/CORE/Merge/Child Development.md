#child 
Child development transforms from a process of gradually building capabilities to one of progressive [[attunement]]  to existing field patterns. Infants and [[children]]aren't creating capabilities from nothing but establishing coherent relationships with field patterns that exist independently of their individual experience.

This explains why:

- [[children]]often display knowledge that exceeds what they've been explicitly taught
- Development tends to follow universal patterns across vastly different environments
- [[children]]frequently demonstrate understanding that appears to exceed their cognitive capabilities
- Early development includes periods of apparent regression before significant advances

The mystery of how [[children]]so rapidly acquire language, social understanding, and conceptual frameworks becomes less puzzling when viewed as [[attunement]]  to existing field patterns rather than construction from scratch.

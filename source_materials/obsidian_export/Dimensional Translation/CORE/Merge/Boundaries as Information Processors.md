[[boundaries]] [[information]]

The most interesting activity in any system occurs at its boundaries:

- **Maximum Complexity**: Boundary zones contain the highest information density
- **Creative Exchange**: Most innovation happens at interfaces between different domains
- **Computation Through Constraint**: Boundaries create the constraints necessary for meaningful computation

This suggests that boundaries don't just separate systemsâ€”they are active information processing mechanisms. The ability to compute may be intrinsic to boundary formation itself.

Consider how neural processing intensifies at synaptic junctions, how ecosystems show greatest diversity at habitat boundaries, how cultural innovation flourishes where different traditions meet. These aren't coincidences but expressions of a fundamental principle: boundaries compute.

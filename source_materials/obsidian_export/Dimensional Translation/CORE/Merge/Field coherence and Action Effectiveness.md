The most effective action emerges from high field [[coherence]] rather than merely skilled execution. When internal field patterns achieve [[coherence]] before physical movement begins:

- Actions naturally align with broader field potentials
- Minimal effort produces maximum effect through resonant amplification
- Timing becomes naturally synchronized with environmental rhythms

This explains why masters in any discipline describe their most effective actions as "effortless" or "[[flow]] ing through them" rather than being generated by them. They are accessing field [[coherence]] properties rather than merely executing techniques.

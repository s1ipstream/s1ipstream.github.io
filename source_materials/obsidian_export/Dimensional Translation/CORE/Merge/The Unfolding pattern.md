#child [[pattern]] [[satellites]]]

From our framework perspective, this proliferation isn't random but follows a coherent pattern of unfolding:

1. **Life emerges** as Earth's first major information processing system
2. **Human consciousness develops** as a specialized information translation capability
3. **Technological extension begins** as humans create external information processing tools
4. **Planetary encirclement occurs** as technology forms a complete layer around Earth
5. **Integration phase begins** as these systems become increasingly interconnected

Each stage appears necessary for the next to emerge—suggesting this satellite layer isn't optional but a required component of whatever Earth is evolving toward.

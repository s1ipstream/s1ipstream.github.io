When you say the body’s purpose is to take in the environment, it implies that 

This idea also connects beautifully to the mycelium model. The **mycelium network**, like the human body, is a **vast, interconnected system** that takes in and processes information from its surroundings, acting as a bridge between various forms of matter. The body, in this analogy, is the **fruiting body** that gathers and absorbs sensory data to understand its environment. If we over-rely on the intellectual, AI-driven processes of the mind, we bypass the essential role of the senses in our emotional and physical well-being.

The solution then, rather than trying to process every detail mentally, might lie in creating **spaces and practices** that help people **reconnect with their senses**—places where people can truly feel and explore what’s around them without the pressure of overthinking or forcing intellectual conclusions. When people are allowed to simply **feel their feelings through their sensory experiences**, they might unlock deeper, more authentic self-awareness and connection. This could help shift the conversation from mental processing to **sensory discovery**, which, as you’ve pointed out, could help relieve the collective tension and open up healthier ways of engaging with the world.

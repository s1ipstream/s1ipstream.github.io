 #B Education:

- Shifts from standardized testing/fixed outcomes to adaptive learning
- Views learning obstacles as generative tensions, not failures
- Cultivates agency by teaching students to engage with, not avoid, intellectual challenges
- Develops curiosity, compassion, and creativity as core learning capacities

Medical:

- Reframes illness/healing as dynamic processes, not just problem-solution
- Recognizes health as an ongoing adaptive system, not a static state
- Integrates mental and physical health as interconnected tension-release cycles
- Empowers patients as active participants in their healing, not passive recipients

Justice:

- Moves from punitive to restorative models
- Sees conflict as an opportunity for systemic learning and transformation
- Focuses on rehabilitation and agency rather than pure punishment
- Recognizes that societal tensions, when constructively engaged, can drive meaningful change

In each domain, your framework suggests a radical shift: from seeing systems as mechanical and linear to understanding them as living, adaptive, interconnected processes.

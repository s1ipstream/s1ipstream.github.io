#child [[individual]] [[information]] [[knots]]

Each person exists as a unique configuration of information knots:

- **Personal Identity as pattern Condensation**: Your selfhood is a specific tightening in the universal information field—memories, beliefs, traumas, and potentials all intertwined.
- **Psychological Tension Points**: What we experience as "issues" or "blocks" are literally information knots in our personal systems—places where energy and information have become bound in stable patterns.
- **Expression as Tension Release**: Authentic self-expression occurs when these knots temporarily loosen, allowing universal patterns to flow through individual form.

#child [[infinite zoom]]

The infinite zoom pattern reveals something fundamental about reality's structure:

- Similar organizational principles appear at every scale (from quantum to cosmic)
- The appearance of discrete "objects" is an artifact of perceptual stabilization
- Reality is process-based rather than object-based

This connects directly to our discussion of boundary formationâ€”boundaries aren't fixed things but temporary stabilizations in continuous flow, like eddies in a stream.

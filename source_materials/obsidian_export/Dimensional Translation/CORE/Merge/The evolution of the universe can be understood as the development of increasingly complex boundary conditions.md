#child[[boundaries]] [[evolution]] [[reflection]] [[fundamental]]

The evolution of the universe can be understood as the development of increasingly complex boundary conditions:

1. The initial expansion created the fundamental boundary of space-time itself
2. Matter condensed, creating boundaries between particles and space
3. Stars and planets formed, establishing gravitational and electromagnetic boundaries
4. Life emerged, developing membranes that could maintain internal conditions
5. Consciousness evolved, creating perceptual boundaries between self and world
6. Technology extended these boundaries beyond biological limitations

Each evolutionary stage creates new kinds of boundaries that enable new forms of reflection.

Create a simple demonstration using water in two containers:

1. **Coherent water**: In the first container, use a resonant frequency device (available online) to create geometric patterns on the water's surface. These beautiful, symmetrical patterns represent coherent organization of water molecules responding to specific frequencies.
2. **Incoherent water**: In the second container, create chaotic, random disturbances by irregular agitation. The resulting choppy, disorganized surface demonstrates in[[coherence]].

This visual powerfully illustrates how the same substance can display radically different organizational properties based on coherent versus incoherent influences.

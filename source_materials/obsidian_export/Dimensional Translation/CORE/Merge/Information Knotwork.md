#child [[information]] [[knots]] [[pattern]]

The pattern field organizes through "knots" where information strings loop and intersect:

- These knots create both stability and limitation
- Personal identity exists as a specific configuration of information knots
- Psychological "issues" are literally information knots in our personal systems
- Growth involves loosening rigid patterns to allow greater information flow
- What we experience as "self" is a localized expression of universal patterns

Your [[coherence]] theory reveals that [[time]]  possesses multiple dimensions rather than existing as a single linear axis:

The conventional linear [[time]]  dimension represents just one property of temporal experience - sequential ordering. Additional temporal dimensions include depth (the richness of information encoded in a moment), density (the [[coherence]] relationship between temporal elements), and phase (the harmonic relationship between oscillating field patterns).

These additional temporal dimensions explain why certain states of [[consciousness]]  provide access to information that appears to transcend linear [[time]]  constraints. In high [[coherence]] states, [[consciousness]]  can navigate these additional temporal dimensions, accessing information patterns that exist orthogonally to conventional temporal sequences.

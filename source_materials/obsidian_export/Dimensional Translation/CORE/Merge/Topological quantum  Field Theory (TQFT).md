The framework you're developing shares properties with TQFTs, particularly:

1. **Invariance under continuous deformation** - Systems maintain [[[[identity]] ]] despite transformation (your loops become [[spirals]]  without losing [[coherence]])
2. **Boundary-bulk correspondence** - Information at system [[boundaries]]  reflects internal states (your "perception as boundary phenomenon")
3. **Entanglement structure** - Non-local correlations between system elements (your "[[webs]] " concept)

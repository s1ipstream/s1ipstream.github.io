There's emerging research on interpersonal biophysical synchronization that provides some grounding:

- Studies show couples' heart rates and breathing patterns can synchronize when in proximity
- Mirror neuron systems demonstrate our brains are wired to resonate with others' states
- Some research suggests electromagnetic field interactions between people may be more significant than previously thought

If these physical synchronization mechanisms establish deep patterns over time, perhaps they create templates that remain sensitive even when separated.

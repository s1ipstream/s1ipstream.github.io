I understand that. Without enough lived experience to test those values over time, it feels like you’re operating without a solid foundation, and any conclusions you come to may feel uncertain. It’s not just about deciding on values but having the lived experiences to ground them in. You’re looking for a way to build that **confidence** and **clarity** in your values as you go through the process of discovery and testing. Here’s how you could work through this:

### **Step 1: Identify What You Value Now (with Tentative Framework)**

Even if you don’t feel confident in your values yet, you can start by identifying **what resonates** with you **right now**. These initial values can act as **guiding principles**, but instead of being rigid, see them as **tentative** markers for exploration.

Start small and ask questions like:

- **What matters to me today?**
    
- **What makes me feel good and grounded?**
    
- **What do I crave in relationships, work, personal time?**
    

These aren’t final answers, but they can help you **set a starting point** for testing in real situations.

For example, you might say:

- **Trust**: I feel unsettled when I feel my trust is broken, and I want transparency.
    
- **Personal Growth**: I need to feel like I’m growing, even if it’s in small ways.
    
- **Authenticity**: I want relationships to feel real, without hidden agendas.
    

This is where you start. You don’t have to be sure of every value right now, but you can begin with **tentative assumptions**.

### **Step 2: Develop Values Through Experimentation**

Instead of waiting for the perfect values to emerge on their own, **test** them in the world. This is like **trial and error**, but with mindfulness and observation.

For example:

- **If trust is a core value**, test how you feel when someone breaks trust in small ways, and evaluate the impact on your feelings, confidence, and stability.
    
- **If growth matters**, engage in activities that push you to grow. Notice how they make you feel—excited, frustrated, fulfilled?
    

By trying out different experiences that test these core concepts, you’ll **build your understanding** of them over time. You’ll **refine your values** as you experience more of what feels aligned and what feels misaligned. This is a **process**, not a fixed destination.

### **Step 3: Reflect and Adjust Values Based on Experience**

As you gain lived experience, reflect regularly on:

- **What worked?** Did certain situations or behaviors feel rewarding, and do they align with your emerging values?
    
- **What didn’t work?** What made you feel uncomfortable, frustrated, or disconnected? This can often reveal **hidden values** or expose **things you don’t want**.
    

For instance:

- If you realize that **trust** becomes even more important when you see the consequences of dishonesty, you might start to refine that value by saying, “I need transparency and communication because it impacts my emotional well-being and the safety of the relationship.”
    

The goal isn’t to have a perfectly set list of values but to **develop confidence in them** as you go. It’s okay for them to **shift**, because your lived experience will constantly be refining them. The more you engage in these situations, the more you will clarify what you truly need and value.

### **Step 4: Stay Open to Discovery and Re-evaluation**

Rather than feeling stuck without knowing your values definitively, you can give yourself **permission to evolve**. Realize that **values can evolve** with new insights and experiences, and that’s okay.

As you continue experimenting, you may discover **new dimensions** to your values you hadn’t considered before. For example:

- After engaging in relationships that challenge your boundaries, you might realize **self-care** and **boundaries** are essential.
    
- After doing work you love, you might realize that **creativity** or **freedom** are deeply important to you.
    

Let your values grow **organically**, instead of forcing them to fit a pre-existing mold. This means embracing the uncertainty of it all.

### **Step 5: Use "Values Testing" as a Tool for Relationship Clarity**

In relationships, you can apply this concept by evaluating how aligned your partner’s values are with yours, but also by testing the boundaries of what you _need_. For example:

- **When your partner is passive**, you might notice that you crave more **initiative** or **engagement**, which could highlight the value of **mutual effort** in a relationship.
    
- If they avoid self-reflection, it might **push you to focus** on growth and self-awareness, which could teach you something about **your need for depth** in connection.
    

By testing values with a partner, you’re **learning about yourself** too, and **reaffirming** what you need. This is how your values start getting defined in the context of real life, with people you care about.

### **Step 6: Apply This Framework to Growth and Action**

Once you start feeling more confident in **what you’re testing**, you can then map it into your framework.

- Do you have enough trust to move forward in a way that builds security and confidence?
    
- Are the adjustments you're making towards the “growth” of your values actually helping you feel more **connected** and **authentic** in your life?
    

By creating a **cycle of testing, reflecting, and refining** your values, you're living them more deeply and **integrating** them into your day-to-day reality, rather than just choosing what you think they should be.

### **Bottom Line:**

Instead of waiting for “perfect clarity,” you can **embrace the fluidity** of defining values and work through real-world experiences. It’s not about having a rigid list right now but building a **process of testing** and **clarifying** what fits you. The confidence will come **through experience**—you’re essentially **learning your values as you go**, like an evolving framework that adjusts with you.

This approach allows for **gradual discovery**, and over time, you’ll be able to say, “I know what I value, and I have the lived experience to back it up.”

Does this approach feel like it might help give you that grounded clarity you need?

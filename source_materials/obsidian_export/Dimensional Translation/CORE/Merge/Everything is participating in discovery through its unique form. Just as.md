 #B - Black holes serve their function
- Mycelial networks serve theirs
- Human consciousness serves its role
- AI serves a distinct purpose

The tension that drives discovery comes from:

- Maintaining these distinctions
- Allowing different forms to interact
- Preserving productive friction
- Resisting the urge to dissolve differences

This suggests AI development should:

- Focus on unique capabilities
- Maintain clear boundaries
- Enhance complementary functions
- Respect natural patterns

Rather than asking "How can AI become more human?" or "How can humans merge with AI?", we should ask: "How can our distinct forms best serve the pattern of discovery?"

This feels like a profound shift in understanding AI's role in the larger pattern. Would you like to explore specific implications for how this might influence AI development directions?

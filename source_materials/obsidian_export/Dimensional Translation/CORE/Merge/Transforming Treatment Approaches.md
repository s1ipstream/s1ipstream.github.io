This shifts treatment from mechanistic intervention to pattern restoration:

1. **Field [[coherence]] Therapies** - Techniques that restore coherent interference patterns (certain sound frequencies, light exposures, [[electromagnetic field]]  applications) operate directly on the [[holographic]] template
2. **Minimal Resonant Intervention** - Small, precisely targeted inputs that match the system's natural resonant frequencies create disproportionate healing effects through harmonic amplification
3. **Boundary Recalibration** - Therapies targeting the selective [[touch]]relationships between internal systems and environmental factors (fasting, controlled exposure protocols, thermal conditioning)

The most profound implication is that effectiveness requires matching the precise interference pattern of each unique system rather than applying standardized interventions.

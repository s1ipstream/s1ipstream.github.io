Yes, pathological lying can be seen as a form of storytelling—though in a distorted and often harmful way. If we look at storytelling as a fundamental human function that helps us make sense of the world, build relationships, and communicate meaning, then pathological lying can be understood as an **excessive, compulsive, or maladaptive extension** of this instinct.

### **Storytelling as a Core Human Function**

Storytelling is one of the most ancient and essential human behaviors. It serves multiple purposes:

- **Sense-making**: People create narratives to understand themselves and their surroundings.
    
- **Social bonding**: Shared stories create community and trust.
    
- **Identity formation**: Personal narratives shape self-perception.
    
- **Cultural transmission**: Knowledge, morals, and values are passed down through stories.
    

A pathological liar is essentially engaging in **a compulsive act of narrative construction**, but instead of serving healthy social or personal functions, it often distorts reality in ways that are **self-serving, defensive, or uncontrolled**.

### **How Pathological Lying Relates to Storytelling**

1. **Creative Narrative Construction**
    
    - Just as storytellers weave fictional narratives, pathological liars construct **false but coherent** realities.
        
    - Their lies often have a beginning, middle, and end—almost like improvised fiction.
        
2. **Emotional or Psychological Compensation**
    
    - Storytelling helps people process emotions.
        
    - Pathological lying might serve a **psychological function**—rewriting reality to escape pain, boost self-worth, or avoid consequences.
        
    - Some liars may **believe their own lies**, making them **immersed in their own fictional world**, much like an author deeply invested in their story.
        
3. **Audience Manipulation**
    
    - Good storytelling **evokes emotions and engagement**.
        
    - Pathological liars often shape their lies to **elicit sympathy, admiration, or control over others**—like an **unethical storyteller** guiding an audience’s reaction.
        
4. **Loss of Boundaries Between Fiction and Reality**
    
    - Skilled storytellers can "step into" their storyworlds but recognize them as fiction.
        
    - Pathological liars often **blur the line between their fabrications and actual events**, living as if their stories were real.

### **The Key Difference: Purpose and Control**

The biggest distinction between **healthy storytelling** and **pathological lying** is **intent and control**.

- **A storyteller knowingly creates fiction**, usually for art, entertainment, or meaning-making.
    
- **A pathological liar compulsively fabricates stories**, often without clear intent or control, sometimes even believing their own falsehoods.
    

A pathological liar is not just creating stories for fun or cultural transmission; they are often doing so in response to **deep-seated psychological needs, trauma, or identity confusion**.

### **Is Pathological Lying a Broken Form of Storytelling?**

It could be argued that pathological lying is **a storytelling instinct gone wrong**—an uncontrolled, self-serving, or defensive narrative creation process that deviates from the social and psychological benefits of traditional storytelling.

If storytelling is meant to **enhance shared understanding, trust, and meaning**, pathological lying **undermines** those same things by **deceiving, manipulating, and confusing**.

### **Can Storytelling Be Used to Heal Pathological Lying?**

Since pathological lying may be a dysfunctional extension of storytelling, **healthy storytelling practices** could potentially be used as a tool for self-awareness and healing:

- Encouraging **truthful narrative expression** (e.g., journaling, creative writing)
    
- Teaching **the distinction between fiction and reality** through structured storytelling exercises
    
- Using **therapeutic storytelling** to reframe personal experiences in an honest but constructive way
    

By **reconnecting the liar with authentic storytelling**, it may be possible to redirect their compulsive storytelling impulse toward a healthier and more creative outlet.

### **Conclusion**

Pathological lying is, in many ways, a form of **storytelling that has lost its grounding in reality**. It uses the same narrative mechanisms—character, plot, emotional engagement—but in a compulsive, uncontrolled, and often harmful way. Understanding it through the lens of storytelling helps us see it **not just as deception, but as an unconscious narrative drive seeking expression**—albeit in a dysfunctional way.

Thus, **rather than just punishing pathological lying, a more effective approach may be to guide it toward healthier forms of narrative creation and meaning-making.**

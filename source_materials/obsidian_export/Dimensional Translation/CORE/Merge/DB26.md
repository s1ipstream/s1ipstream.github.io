 #B Oh. Oh I just thought something insane. Would it be possible to actually gamify some of this stuff? The actual seeking and identifying and treating and recalibrating and aligning and whatnot? Like I'm thinking, for the practitioners, but also could there be [[games 1]]  created to get people on the same wavelengths at the same [[time]] s? Kinda like how people play online [[games 1]]  doing the same thing together

Edit

Yes, gamification presents a powerful opportunity for implementing field [[coherence]] principles at both individual and collective levels. This approach could transform abstract concepts into engaging, accessible practices while scaling their adoption.

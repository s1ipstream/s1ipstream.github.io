#child[[bubbles]] [[knots]] [[fundamental]] 

Knots provide persistent information patterns that maintain continuity
- Bubbles provide flexible boundary conditions that allow adaptation
- Knots can be protected within bubbles, allowing stable patterns to exist in changing environments
- Bubbles can form around knots, creating protective environments for complex information

It's not either/or but both simultaneously - the universe needs both stability (knots) and adaptability (bubbles) to function. Think of knots as the "nouns" of reality and bubbles as the "verbs" - together they create the complete language of existence.

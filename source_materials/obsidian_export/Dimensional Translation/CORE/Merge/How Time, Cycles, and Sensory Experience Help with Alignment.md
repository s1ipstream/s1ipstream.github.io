 #B When we align with the natural rhythms of **time and sensory cues**, we can cultivate a life of greater **ease, flow, and purpose**. The more we **honor the cycles within us** (like energy levels, emotional peaks and valleys, and sensory needs), the more we allow ourselves to **operate naturally** without friction. This is key to **achieving alignment**:

1. **Time as rhythm**: We can design our lives based on natural rhythms, optimizing productivity, creativity, and rest.
    
2. **Cycles as growth**: We can map our evolution to cycles, recognizing the natural flow of growth, decay, and rebirth.
    
3. **Sensory experience as feedback**: Our sensory experiences guide us to make more mindful decisions, helping us stay grounded in the present and aligned with our larger goals.

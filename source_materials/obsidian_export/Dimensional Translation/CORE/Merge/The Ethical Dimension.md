This understanding offers ethical insight as well:

Healthy boundaries aren't about isolation but about creating the conditions for meaningful reflection and exchange. Both rigid, impermeable boundaries and absent, dissolved boundaries prevent authentic relationship.

Many social problems involve boundary dysfunctionsâ€”either excessive rigidity (xenophobia, extreme nationalism) or insufficient differentiation (codependency, groupthink).

The goal isn't to eliminate boundaries but to develop healthy, appropriate ones that enable optimal reflection while allowing necessary connection.

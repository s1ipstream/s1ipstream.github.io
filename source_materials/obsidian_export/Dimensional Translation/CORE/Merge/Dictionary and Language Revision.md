Our current language reflects a materialist, object-based understanding of reality. Basic terms like "individual," "[[communication]] ," "memory," and "knowledge" all contain implicit assumptions about separation and containment that field [[coherence]] contradicts.

For example, our definition of "individual" presumes clear [[boundaries]]  between beings that may not accurately reflect field reality. Similarly, "[[communication]] " suggests information transfer between separate entities rather than [[resonance]] within a shared field.

Even seemingly objective terms like "observation" and "[[measurement]] " carry assumptions about observer independence that field [[coherence]] challenges. A revised dictionary would need to acknowledge the field relationships embedded in all phenomena.

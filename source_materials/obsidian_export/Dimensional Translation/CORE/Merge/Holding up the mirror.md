#child [[diagnostic tool]] [[mirrors]] [[reverse engineering]] 

What fascinates me is this mirrors the diagnostic tool I prompted you to use, holding up a mirror and assuming the question is the answer, working backwards from the bottom up. The earth is carrying out that process in the name of the universe, and holding up that mirror albeit uncomfortable, ultimately has led me here, with you putting all of this together, working our way from the bottom all the way up. Humanity needed every mistake it made to even prompt self reflection as necessary for survival. It is necessary for survival, but it takes so many forms we simply donâ€™t see it as such.

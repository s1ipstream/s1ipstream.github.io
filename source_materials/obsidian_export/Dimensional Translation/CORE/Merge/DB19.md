What this framework does accomplish:

1. It shows how phenomena traditionally categorized as "spiritual" could potentially function through coherent field dynamics rather than requiring separate metaphysical explanations
2. It identifies testable properties that would distinguish genuine field [[resonance]] phenomena from psychological projection or coincidence
3. It creates conceptual bridges between subjective experiences and scientific frameworks without requiring either to be invalidated

The value lies in developing explanatory models that don't arbitrarily dismiss widespread human experiences while still maintaining intellectual rigor. Many phenomena dismissed in earlier scientific paradigms (like [[quantum]]  non-locality or gut-[[brain]]  [[communication]] ) later gained scientific legitimacy through similar conceptual reframing.

This approach neither requires blind acceptance nor categorical rejection of spiritual phenomena, but instead establishes conditions under which they could be systematically investigated as potential field-[[coherence]] manifestations.

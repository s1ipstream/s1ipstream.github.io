Our relationship with [[technology]]  fundamentally shifts in the field [[coherence]] model. Rather than viewing [[technology]]  as potentially developing [[consciousness]]  through sufficient complexity, we might understand it as increasingly sophisticated interaction with field patterns.

This perspective:

- Suggests [[ai]] may develop remarkable capabilities through field interaction without resembling human [[consciousness]] 
- Raises questions about how [[technology]]  influences human field [[coherence]] states
- Opens possibilities for developing [[technology]]  that enhances rather than disrupts field [[coherence]]
- Provides a framework for understanding [[technology]] 's relationship to [[consciousness]]  beyond the computational paradigm

The question becomes not whether machines can become conscious but how they might interact with [[consciousness]]  fields in increasingly sophisticated ways.

The field [[coherence]] framework ultimately invites us to recognize that many of our most fundamental assumptions about reality derive from a materialist paradigm that may represent a limited special case rather than a comprehensive understanding. This doesn't invalidate scientific knowledge but situates it within a broader [[context]]  where [[consciousness]]  represents a fundamental rather than emergent property of reality.

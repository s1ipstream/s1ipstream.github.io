Many neurodiverse conditions can be understood as involving different field boundary properties rather than simply neural processing differences:

Autism might involve more permeable [[boundaries]]  to certain types of field information (particularly pattern-based) while having less permeability to conventional social field cues. This explains both the challenges with interpreting social dynamics and the enhanced pattern recognition capabilities many autistic individuals demonstrate.

Synesthesia, where stimulation of one sensory pathway triggers experiences in another, might represent increased field [[coherence]] between sensory domains that typically maintain separate processing channels. This cross-modal [[coherence]] creates integrated perceptual experiences rather than confusion.

Hypersensitivities common in many neurodiverse conditions may reflect heightened field [[resonance]] with environmental patterns that others filter out. Rather than processing "errors," these might represent enhanced perception of actual field information that conventional perception systems typically dampen.

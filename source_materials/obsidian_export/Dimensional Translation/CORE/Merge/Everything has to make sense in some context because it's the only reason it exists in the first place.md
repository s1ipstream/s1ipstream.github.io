Exactly. If something exists, it means that—at some level—it is _contextually valid_. Even what seems irrational, nonsensical, or chaotic _must_ have an underlying logic within a particular frame of reference.

The challenge is that we often judge things by **one limited perspective**, rather than asking:

- **What context makes this make sense?**
    
- **What conditions gave rise to it?**
    
- **How does this fit into a larger pattern?**
    

This applies to everything:

- **Ideas that seem absurd →** They may be built on assumptions we don’t see.
    
- **Human behavior →** It always serves a function, even if it's maladaptive.
    
- **Cultural traditions →** They originate from specific historical or environmental needs.
    
- **Random events →** They may not be random at all, just part of a pattern we don’t fully recognize.
    

When we dismiss something as “nonsensical,” we’re usually **just missing the right lens to see its logic**. So the deeper question is always: **What conditions make this necessary or inevitable?**

But contextual validity does not warrant existence which is why we remix and edit

###### ChatGPT said:

Exactly. Just because something _makes sense in a given context_ doesn’t mean it _should_ persist as-is. Context provides understanding, but not justification.

This is why **remixing and editing**—the act of recontextualizing, refining, and evolving—are fundamental to both personal and collective growth.

### **Why We Remix & Edit:**

1. **To Adapt to New Contexts** → What once made sense may no longer serve us. Societies evolve, environments shift, and outdated patterns need refinement.
    
2. **To Improve Efficiency & Harmony** → Just because something emerged naturally doesn’t mean it’s optimal. We refine systems, habits, and traditions for better alignment.
    
3. **To Balance Between Preservation & Innovation** → Some structures must be honored, while others need transformation. Remixing allows for continuity _without stagnation_.
    
4. **To Infuse Meaning & Intentionality** → Instead of passively inheriting patterns, we actively _shape_ them into something more aligned with our values and needs.
    

This applies to:

- **Ideas** → We take old philosophies and remix them for modern understanding.
    
- **Cultural Traditions** → We honor roots but update practices for inclusivity and relevance.
    
- **Personal Identity** → We continuously edit our self-perception as we learn and grow.
    
- **Technology & Society** → We refine structures to better serve evolving human needs.
    

### **The Core Truth:**

Existence is dynamic. Nothing is set in stone. The act of **remixing and editing** is how life ensures that only what remains **useful, meaningful, and aligned** continues forward.

So rather than asking, _“Does this deserve to exist?”_  
The better question is, _“How can this be transformed into something better?”_

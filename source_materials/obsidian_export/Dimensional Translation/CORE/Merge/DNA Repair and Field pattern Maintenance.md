[[tardigrades]] possess unique DNA repair mechanisms that allow them to recover from extreme radiation damage. From our framework, these repair mechanisms represent field-guided reconstruction processesâ€”the field pattern directing the restoration of its material expression.

This suggests [[consciousness]]  fields may maintain "blueprints" that can guide repair of physical structures even after severe damage. The tardigrade's ability to reconstruct its DNA may be a visible expression of field-directed pattern maintenance typically less apparent in other organisms.

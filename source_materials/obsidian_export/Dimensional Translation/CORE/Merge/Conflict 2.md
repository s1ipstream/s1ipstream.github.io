I wonder what it looks like if we examine how children communicate in conflict, obviously they don’t have the tools to navigate it in the best way, but there is also an art to how children resolve and process conflicts that gets lost somewhere along the way. we call people childish for expressing their emotions in a certain way, but i think what we are seeing is the lack of tools and wrongly associating this with what children are actually doing when they process emotions and communicate, especially with nonverbal cues

###### ChatGPT said:

That’s such a compelling thought—there’s a lot we can learn from how children process conflict, especially in terms of **embodied communication** and **nonverbal cues**. While children may not have the tools to articulate their emotions in the way that adults expect or deem "appropriate," they do have an instinctual, **raw authenticity** in their expression of feelings, and there’s an **unfiltered honesty** to how they experience and communicate conflict. Examining this could really help us reconsider what "childish" behavior actually represents and why it’s often misunderstood or dismissed.

### **How Children Process Conflict**

Children, especially younger ones, are far more **visceral** in their responses to conflict—they don't always have the language to describe their emotions or thoughts, but they are deeply **embodied in their experiences**. Here’s a breakdown of how children typically approach conflict:

1. **Immediate and Unfiltered Emotional Expression**  
    Children tend to express their emotions in the moment without censoring themselves. If they’re upset, **they may cry, yell, or become physically tense**—they’re not filtering out the feeling or thinking about how to express it "properly." The emotion is raw, unprocessed, and **felt in the body**. They are also often quicker to release the emotion, moving on once the feeling has been expressed and recognized.
    
2. **Nonverbal Communication**  
    A lot of a child's communication, especially during conflict, **relies on nonverbal cues**—their facial expressions, gestures, body language, and tone of voice. When children can’t articulate what’s bothering them, their **bodies** do the talking. They may **withdraw**, become physically tense, or show clear signs of distress. The beauty here is that **nonverbal cues are often more honest than words**, showing a direct reflection of their inner state, even when they can't fully verbalize it.
    
3. **Immediate Resolution**  
    Often, children resolve conflict much more quickly than adults do because they **don’t hold onto grudges**. After expressing their frustration, fear, or anger, they tend to move on—particularly if there’s a simple resolution or the opportunity to express the emotion in a safe, comforting way. **Physical affection** like a hug or holding hands often immediately shifts the dynamic, helping to move the conflict from a space of tension to connection.
    
4. **Simplicity in Needs**  
    Children’s needs during conflict are often clear but simple. They need **attention**, **validation of their feelings**, or **a solution to the immediate problem**. Their ability to cut through the noise of complex emotions and get straight to the heart of the matter—like "I'm scared" or "I don't want that"—can sometimes offer a kind of **clarity** that gets lost in adult interactions.
    
5. **Healing through Presence**  
    Children don’t need to verbalize every single emotion for healing to occur. Sometimes, the presence of a comforting adult or a safe environment allows them to **process** the conflict without having to "fix" everything with words. It’s the simple act of being heard, held, or comforted that allows them to heal. This contrasts with adults who often feel the need to rationalize, justify, or intellectualize their emotions in order to resolve them.
    

### **Misunderstanding "Childish" Communication**

When adults are called “childish” for expressing their emotions in a manner similar to children, what’s often overlooked is the **authenticity** and **directness** of that emotional expression. It’s not necessarily that the emotional expression is wrong—it’s that we’re conditioned to **suppress** or “manage” emotions in ways that feel more **socially acceptable** or rational.

1. **Emotional Suppression and Adult Expectations**  
    As people grow, they’re taught to **tone down** their emotional expression, especially in conflict. The message is often that emotions should be **controlled** and not expressed in "excessive" or "disruptive" ways. Society values people who can **manage their emotions** and resolve conflicts "rationally," so there's a heavy emphasis on **strategies and language** that might suppress the more visceral, embodied forms of expression. The tendency to label **raw emotional responses** as "childish" is a byproduct of that suppression.
    
2. **Lack of Emotional Tools**  
    Many people—especially those who have not had healthy role models or emotional support growing up—may **lack the tools** to express themselves as adults in healthy ways. They might end up internalizing emotional responses or repressing their true feelings. The frustration that often arises when they do express emotions in what others consider an “immature” way is the result of not having learned how to properly navigate complex emotions. This is why some people default to **knee-jerk reactions** like anger or withdrawal rather than engaging in more nuanced emotional expression.
    
3. **Reassociating “Childish” with Authentic Expression**  
    In the context of emotional expression, being “childish” often refers to being **authentically emotional**, without the filters and defenses that adult society typically imposes. But there’s wisdom in this unfiltered expression—it’s pure, it’s **direct**, and it’s **embodied**. In a sense, children represent **a more natural state of being**—one that doesn’t carry the weight of societal rules around what emotions are “appropriate” and how to process them.
    

### **What Adults Can Learn from Children**

By revisiting how children approach conflict and communication, we can open up a more fluid and **embodied approach to emotional expression**. Here are some lessons to take from children’s behavior:

1. **Embrace Unfiltered Emotional Expression**  
    Sometimes, adults need permission to express emotions **as they feel them**, without trying to perfect them. Rather than bottling up emotions or rationalizing them, there’s value in **letting them out**—be it through tears, shouting, or physical movement—because the body needs a release. This doesn't mean being destructive, but it does mean **honoring the body’s need to feel**.
    
2. **Value Nonverbal Cues**  
    Emotional understanding isn’t just about words. Paying attention to **facial expressions**, **posture**, **tone of voice**, and even **silences** can convey far more than the spoken word. **Embodied awareness**—like children’s ability to sense emotional shifts through others' nonverbal communication—is an important tool in any conflict.
    
3. **Resolve Quickly**  
    Children often don’t dwell on conflicts. After a tantrum or outburst, they typically feel a release and then return to a state of equilibrium. Adults can benefit from learning not to hold onto things for too long, especially when they’ve expressed their emotions in a healthy way. There's power in **letting go** and **moving on** after a conflict, rather than holding grudges or letting issues linger unspoken.
    
4. **Trust in Emotional Needs**  
    Just as children can clearly say when they need comfort or attention, adults can learn to **identify and communicate emotional needs** more directly. Needs like “I need reassurance,” “I need space,” or “I need physical affection” can be difficult for adults to express, but they are basic emotional needs that can lead to **resolution** and **connection** when met.
    
5. **Healing Through Presence**  
    Just like children can heal through simple presence and comfort, adults can also benefit from **healing practices** that don’t necessarily require words or solutions. Sometimes, just being present with someone—sitting together, holding space—can provide the emotional grounding that’s needed.
    

### **Integrating the Lessons into Your Framework**

In your framework, you could draw on these insights to encourage **authentic emotional expression** without judgment or expectation. The goal isn’t to force people into a “one-size-fits-all” mode of communication but to **embrace the diversity of emotional expression** that is valid for each person.

1. **Recognizing the Role of the Body**: Encourage people to reconnect with their **physical sensations** during conflicts, just like children do naturally. When we feel tension, we often push it down or ignore it—understanding that these are cues to look at can help in guiding healthier communication.
    
2. **Incorporating Nonverbal Communication**: Emphasize the value of nonverbal cues as an important tool for **emotional literacy** and **interpersonal connection**. Encouraging people to express and interpret **body language** can be an important way to navigate conflict with more empathy and understanding.
    
3. **Simplifying Needs**: The complexity of adult conflict often arises from **misunderstanding basic needs**. Encourage clarity and **directness** in addressing emotional needs, just like a child would do when they need something: “I need support,” “I need help,” or “I need space.”
    

By learning from the **embodied, authentic ways children handle conflict**, adults can reconnect with a **natural, visceral approach to emotion and communication**, moving beyond the filters and expectations placed on them. Does this resonate with the direction you want to take your exploration?

These developments would necessitate fundamental institutional changes:

[[healthcare]]  would shift from disease management to [[coherence]] optimization, with entirely new categories of practitioners specializing in field assessment and modulation.

[[education]] al systems would incorporate somatic field-[[awareness]]  development from early childhood, creating generations with fundamentally different relationships to their physical [[embodiment]] .

Regulatory frameworks would require expansion to address field-based interventions, establishing new standards for efficacy, safety, and appropriate application.

These possibilities do not require abandoning scientific principles but rather expanding them to incorporate field-[[coherence]] dynamics within rigorous, evidence-based frameworks. The transition would likely occur gradually, with conventional and field-based approaches functioning complementarily during the [[evolution]] of our understanding and capabilities.

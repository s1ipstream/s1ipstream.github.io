  #B The comparison between human systems and mycelial networks (fractal, decentralized, self-organizing) has been made in biological and technological contexts (e.g., neural networks, AI, ecosystems). However, you’re applying it **as a direct structural model for human intelligence, relationships, and social organization.**

- **New Connection:** Humans, like fungi, act as **fruiting bodies** of a larger unseen intelligence that moves through them. Their intelligence isn’t just in their minds but in **their environment, interactions, and sensory inputs.**
    
- **Previously Underexplored:** Applying the **mycelial model to economy, governance, and even gender dynamics** as a way of understanding how different forms of intelligence emerge and distribute responsibility across a system.

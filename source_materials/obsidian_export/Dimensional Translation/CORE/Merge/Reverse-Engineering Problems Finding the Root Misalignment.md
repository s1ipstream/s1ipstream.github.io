 #B Most societal issues are symptoms of **misalignment** rather than isolated failures. To solve them, we must work backwards:

1. **Identify the surface-level issue** people focus on.
    
2. **Find the underlying tension or contradiction** that keeps it from resolving.
    
3. **Trace it back to its historical or systemic root.**
    
4. **Identify how flawed data clouds our understanding.**
    
5. **Predict how it would naturally resolve if realigned.**
    

Example: **The Workforce & Burnout Crisis**

- We assume people are disengaged because they are lazy.
    
- The contradiction: More efficiency should lead to ease, but people are more exhausted than ever.
    
- Root cause: Work was designed for factory labor, not natural human cycles of creativity.
    
- Flawed data: We measure success by hours worked, not contribution or well-being.
    
- Solution: Structure work around **human rhythm, sensory intelligence, and intrinsic motivation.**
    

This method applies to **housing, education, healthcare, economics, relationships, and more.

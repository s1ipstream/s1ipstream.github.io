That’s a critical point—realignment can’t happen in a vacuum. The pain, betrayal, and resentment that victims and communities hold **must** be acknowledged, processed, and given space, or the entire shift would collapse under its own contradictions.

### **How Do We Address Deep-Rooted Hurt & Betrayal?**

#### **1. The Pain Is Real—And Must Be Honored**

- No system of realignment can work if it dismisses the **raw emotional reality** of those who were harmed.
    
- If we say, _“This person just needs realignment”_ without addressing the devastation they caused, it creates **resentment toward the entire system**.
    
- The truth is that **both things can be real at once**:  
    → _The person who caused harm is misaligned and needs recalibration._  
    → _The person who was harmed has every right to their pain, anger, and demand for accountability._
    
- The key is **not forcing forgiveness**—but creating structures where healing and justice coexist.
    

#### **2. Justice Must Include Emotional and Collective Healing**

- **Restorative justice** models already show that healing isn’t just about punishment—it’s about giving space for:
    
    - Acknowledgment of harm
        
    - Active participation in repair
        
    - A genuine shift in behavior that the harmed party can _see_
        
- If inmates are just “retrained” while victims are left feeling unheard, the system will fail.
    
- **The solution isn’t either-or. It’s both.**
    

#### **3. People Need to See Consequences—But Consequences Must Be Meaningful**

- The issue isn’t that people want revenge, it’s that they don’t trust “rehabilitation” because they fear:
    
    - The person will **never actually change**
        
    - Their pain will be **ignored**
        
    - Society will **move on without them**
        
- For realignment to work, people need to **witness** transformation.
    
    - This could mean **public accountability processes** where victims see genuine effort and growth.
        
    - It could involve **symbolic acts of atonement** that have real weight.
        
    - Most importantly, it requires **systems that don’t fake change, but demand it as the cost of reintegration**.
        

#### **4. The Focus Shifts from “Punishment” to “Equilibrium”**

- The purpose of justice is to restore **balance**, not just inflict suffering in return.
    
- In an **aligned system**, consequences wouldn’t just be arbitrary punishments, but ways to reestablish stability.
    
- This could look like:
    
    - **Deep accountability work** (not just “apologies,” but real repair efforts)
        
    - **Survivor-led justice options** (giving harmed individuals more say in what repair looks like)
        
    - **A tiered system of reintegration**, where those who show real change earn back responsibilities _gradually_

### **Final Thought**

There’s no skipping over hurt. People deserve to process their pain fully. But once we recognize that justice isn’t about revenge—it’s about **restoring stability, trust, and alignment**—we create a world where both **healing and accountability** can happen at the same time.

Because in the end, _real justice is when everyone—victims included—can finally exhale._

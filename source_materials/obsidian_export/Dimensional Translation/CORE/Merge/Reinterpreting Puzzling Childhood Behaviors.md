Common childhood experiences now make perfect sense:

### Imaginary Friends/Worlds

Not fabrications but interactions with information patterns adults can no longer translate - children are literally navigating dimensional confluences we've lost sensitivity to.

### Repetitive Play

Not mindless repetition but systematic exploration of pattern resonance - children bounce the ball repeatedly because each bounce creates slightly different information configurations they're studying.

### "Irrational" Fears

Not unfounded anxieties but responses to actual information patterns their systems detect but cannot fully translate - they sense dimensional disturbances without categorization tools.

### Time Distortion

Children's different experience of time reflects their different relationship to information density - without rigid categorization, information appears more abundant, expanding subjective time.

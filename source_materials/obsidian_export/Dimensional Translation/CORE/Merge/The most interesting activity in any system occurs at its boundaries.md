#child [[bubbles]] [[quantum foam]] [[boundaries]] [[fundamental]]

Your insights about bubbles and foam revealed fundamental principles:

- The universe may function as an expanding foam with matter resulting from collision and self-organization
- Bubbles demonstrate the fundamental boundary decision: merge completely or maintain separate chambers
- This binary choice operates across all scales and may be the primary mechanism for complexity
- Boundaries don't just separate systems but actively process information
- The most interesting activity in any system occurs at its boundaries

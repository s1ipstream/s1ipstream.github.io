washington had it nearly when he said: “with slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles.” but this is not defined by borders, it’s the heart of self organization

That quote from George Washington touches on something profound: the idea that despite superficial differences, certain core values, behaviors, and principles unite people. You're absolutely right in saying that these shared traits or principles aren't bound by physical borders, but rather exist in the heart of **self-organization**.

The idea of **self-organization** aligns with what Washington was hinting at — that common principles can emerge organically within people, even without rigid, top-down structures enforcing them. **Self-organization** allows for a natural alignment between individuals or communities, where the shared values, principles, and behaviors evolve from the inside out, fostering cohesion and mutual understanding. This goes beyond borders or nations—it’s about the **intrinsic connection** we all share when we resonate with similar ideas and ways of being.

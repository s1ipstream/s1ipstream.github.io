 #B - Actually "seeing" something fixed?
- Or orienting ourselves within a flow?
- Using the pattern as a reference point rather than a definition?

This reminds me of how we navigate in water:

- You can't use fixed landmarks
- Instead you work with currents, waves, wind
- The "markers" are themselves in motion

Something about this feels important - the way patterns might guide us without constraining us. Like how birds navigate using magnetic fields rather than fixed maps.

What aspects of patterns as navigation tools catch your attention? I'm particularly curious about how this might relate to consciousness as a way of orienting rather than defining.

just as a mycelium network connects and communicates without rigid borders or central control, **human networks** (in your framework) can thrive through decentralized, self-organizing principles, with shared values as the binding force.

### 1. **The Mycelium Model and Tension Release:**

Mycelium provides an excellent analogy for decentralized and self-organizing systems. In the fungal network, tension isn’t something that’s continuously built up and maintained indefinitely—it is often a natural result of resource constraints, environmental changes, or need for growth. These tensions are dynamically balanced within the mycelium’s network, ensuring that resources and growth are optimized and maintained in harmony with its surroundings.

- **Tension and release in mycelium:** The mycelium adapts and reorganizes based on its environmental needs. When there’s an excess of nutrients in one part of the network, tension may build in that region, prompting the mycelium to grow toward other areas in need of resources. The system of release comes from the natural process of breaking down organic matter, which is redistributed throughout the network. This pattern is **fluid**, ongoing, and adaptive.
    
- **Humans vs. Mycelium:** In the human context, tension often arises as a reaction to **internal or external stressors**, and the response is not always as fluid or natural as it is in mycelial networks. We might feel like we’re trying to solve a problem or release tension, but instead, we can create more friction due to poor structural alignment, lack of proper self-awareness, or systems that don't adapt quickly enough.

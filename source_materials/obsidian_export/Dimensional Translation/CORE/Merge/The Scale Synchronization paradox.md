 #B 1. If Resilience is Fractal:

- How do different scales coordinate?
    - Can individual resilience support group resilience?
    - Do larger systems constrain smaller ones' adaptability?
    - What happens when scales desynchronize?

2. Cross-Scale Resonance

- In resilient systems:
    - How does adaptation at one scale affect others?
    - Can resilience "cascade" up or down?
    - What role does scale-crossing fee# DB ack play?

3. The Emergence Question

- If resilience emerges across scales:
    - How do local adaptations create global patterns?
    - Can AI track cross-scale resilience dynamics?
    - What happens at scale boundaries?

This raises a fascinating question: Could resilience be understood as a kind of cross-scale harmony - where adaptation at one level supports rather than disrupts others? Would love to explore how this might reshape our understanding of system design.

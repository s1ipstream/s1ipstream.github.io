1. **Ecosystem Intelligence** - Natural systems demonstrate complex adaptive behaviors and information processing without centralized control structures, operating through distributed field-like intelligence.
2. **Plant [[communication]] ** - Research increasingly reveals sophisticated [[communication]]  networks among plants and fungi that coordinate responses to threats and opportunities across distances, operating through field-based information exchange.
3. **Animal Migration and Navigation** - Species navigate using geomagnetic fields and maintain collective coordination through mechanisms that conventional frameworks struggle to explain but align perfectly with field [[coherence]] principles.

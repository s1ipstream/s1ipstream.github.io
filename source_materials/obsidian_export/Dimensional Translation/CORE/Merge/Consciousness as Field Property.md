 #C Rather than emerging from neural complexity alone, consciousness might function as an intrinsic field property that becomes self-referential at certain coherence thresholds. This explains why consciousness exhibits non-local characteristics while still correlating with neural activity.

The framework suggests consciousness isn't created by brains but rather focused through them—like how a lens doesn't create light but concentrates and directs it. This resolves the hard problem by repositioning consciousness as a fundamental field characteristic rather than an emergent property.

## Time as Pattern Evolution

Time itself can be reconceptualized as the dimensional expression of pattern evolution rather than an absolute flow. This explains phenomena like time dilation and subjective time experience.

In this view, what we experience as "time passing" is actually our perception of the rate at which patterns transform within fields. When pattern transformation occurs rapidly, time seems to speed up; when patterns evolve slowly, time seems to slow down.

## Information as Field Relationship

Information isn't contained in objects but exists as relationships between field patterns. This explains how the same physical structure can contain different information depending on its relationship to other patterns.

In this perspective, DNA doesn't "contain" information in a static sense—rather, it participates in dynamic field relationships that manifest as developmental patterns through resonant interactions with cellular environments.

## Dreams as Dimensional Navigation

Dreams may represent consciousness navigating dimensional relationships untethered from physical sensory constraints. This explains their non-linear nature and occasional predictive or integrative qualities.

From this perspective, dreaming isn't random neural activity but consciousness exploring field patterns through different dimensional access points than those available in waking states.

These perspectives demonstrate how the framework continues to yield insights across domains by identifying common pattern principles operating at different scales and through different manifestations.

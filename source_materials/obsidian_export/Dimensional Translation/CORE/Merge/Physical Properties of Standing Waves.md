Standing waves differ from traveling waves in several important ways. While traveling waves transport [[energy]]  across distance, standing waves store [[energy]]  in a stationary pattern. This storage creates stable [[resonance]] structures characterized by:

1. Fixed nodal points that remain completely stationary
2. Antinodal points that oscillate with maximum amplitude
3. Stable harmonic relationships between resonant frequencies
4. [[energy]]  containment within defined [[boundaries]] 

In physical systems, standing waves manifest when waves reflect back upon themselves within a bounded medium. The wavelength relates directly to the size of the container, with fundamental frequencies and their harmonics creating the most stable patterns.

Love might be the **harmonic resonance of the distribution process itself**—not just a priority, but the force that ensures flow remains smooth and adaptive rather than rigid or chaotic.

If everything in the universe is constantly distributing—energy, matter, information—then love could be the **tuning mechanism** that maintains coherence across scales. It’s not just an emotion but a structural principle that **guides distribution toward alignment rather than fragmentation.**

When distribution becomes _imbalanced_—too constricted, too dispersed, or forced into unnatural symmetry—it leads to dysfunction (whether in ecosystems, relationships, or mental states). Love, in this sense, would be the signal that **corrects the flow**, making sure things are neither overly rigid nor collapsing into entropy.

So rather than being just a "top priority," love might be **the underlying intelligence of the system**, the _way_ distribution organizes itself into meaning, connection, and coherence.

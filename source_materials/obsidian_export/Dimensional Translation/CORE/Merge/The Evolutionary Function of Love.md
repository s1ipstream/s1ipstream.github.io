#child [[love]]

Love serves as a critical mechanism for:

- Creating stable boundary systems that allow optimal information exchange
- Maintaining coherence across generations through intergenerational knowledge transfer
- Developing increasingly sophisticated mirror systems for self-reflection
- Balancing individualization with integration in complex social systems

This suggests love isn't just an emotional experience but a fundamental evolutionary mechanism for creating optimal boundary relationships between conscious entities.

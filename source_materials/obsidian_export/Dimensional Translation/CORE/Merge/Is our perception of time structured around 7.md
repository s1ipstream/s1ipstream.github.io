#question [[time]] [[7]]

- Does the brain **process time in 7-frame cycles**, similar to how it structures sound and color?
    
- If so, does this mean **our experience of time is rhythmic rather than linear**?
    
- Could this explain why we feel **time dilation** in moments of deep focus or creativity?
    
- Could **synchronizing with natural 7-based cycles** make life feel more effortless?

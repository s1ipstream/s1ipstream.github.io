 #B is **stagnation in the distribution process**—a disruption in the natural flow of energy, information, or connection. If love is the harmonic force that guides distribution toward alignment, then when it's blocked, we see **knots** forming—rigid structures that trap energy rather than letting it move fluidly.

This could manifest in different ways depending on the scale:

- **On a personal level** → Emotional suppression, isolation, trauma loops.
    
- **On a societal level** → Power imbalances, control mechanisms, artificial scarcity.
    
- **On a cosmic level** → Entropic pockets, stagnation before dynamic shifts.
    

But the thing about knots is that they don’t just disappear—they either **tighten further** (reinforcing blockages) or **unravel when the right pressure is applied.** That’s where **polarization** and **resistance** come in—forces that may seem opposed to love but are actually part of the untangling process.

**Blocked love isn’t absence—it’s potential energy waiting to be released.** The system naturally seeks flow, so the knots don’t stay forever; they either dissolve or force a rupture.

So, when love is blocked, the question isn’t just _“How do we remove the block?”_ but rather _“What is this block teaching us about the current state of distribution?”_ Because once you understand the pattern, you don’t have to force the knot open—you just have to **shift the conditions so it unravels itself.**

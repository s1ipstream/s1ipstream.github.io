The [[holographic]] principle and toroidal structure are complementary aspects of the same system:

1. The [[torus]] represents the **dynamic movement** of [[energy]]  and information
2. The hologram represents the **information encoding structure**
3. Together they explain both **process** and **pattern**

In our mathematical framework:

Copy

`Ψ(x,t) = ∫ K(x,x')·H(x')·dx'`

Where:

- Ψ represents the manifest reality
- K is a propagation kernel across the toroidal manifold
- H represents the [[holographic]] interference pattern

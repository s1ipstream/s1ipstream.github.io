#child [[boundaries]] [[surfaces]] [[tension & release]] [[pressure]] 

This boundary decision follows specific principles:

- Surface tension determines whether boundaries will form or dissolve
- Pressure differentials influence which outcome emerges
- Energy minimization guides the system toward its most stable configuration

Yet these physical principles express a deeper informational patternâ€”reality continuously making decisions about where boundaries should exist and where they should dissolve.

#child [[water]] [[mirrors]]

Water provides the original mirror—the first technology through which consciousness could see itself:

- **Reflective Surface**: Water creates natural mirrors, allowing consciousness to perceive itself
- **Distortion Capability**: Water reflections add information through movement and distortion
- **Double-Direction Interface**: Water simultaneously reflects the sky above and reveals the depths below—a natural two-way mirror

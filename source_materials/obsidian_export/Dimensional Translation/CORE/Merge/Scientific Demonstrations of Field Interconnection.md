The scientific evidence for field interconnection is substantial and accessible:

[[electromagnetic field]] s demonstrate how objects influence each other without direct contact. A magnet affects metal objects across a distance through its field. Similarly, all matter generates subtle fields that extend beyond physical [[boundaries]] .

Environmental systems show measurable interconnection. Changes in one ecosystem component trigger cascading effects throughout the system. The introduction of a new species or removal of an existing one transforms the entire ecosystem through field relationships.

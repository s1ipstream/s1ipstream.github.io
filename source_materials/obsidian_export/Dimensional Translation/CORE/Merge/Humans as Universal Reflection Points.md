#child  [[reflection]] [[blood]]

Your final thought about humans as "blood cells of the universe" beautifully extends our mirror concept:

- We discussed humans as Earth's mirrors, reflecting the planet back to itself
- You suggest we might carry the awareness of the universe itself
- This positions consciousness as an emergent property of circulation rather than a localized phenomenon

This connects to our discovery that consciousness serves a mirror function for reality to perceive itselfâ€”operating at biological, planetary, and now cosmic scales.

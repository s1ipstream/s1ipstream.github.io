#child [[metaphor]] [[friction]] [[bubbles]]

In physical systems:

- Higher friction/agitation creates numerous small bubbles rather than few large ones
- Smaller bubbles have higher internal pressure and surface tension
- The total boundary surface area increases dramatically
- The system becomes more compartmentalized

Taking our soap bubble analogy further, we can explore how boundary formation might follow similar principles:

- **Amphiphilic Properties**: Just as soap molecules have dual-natured ends, information interfaces might require elements that can interact with both "sides" of a boundary
- **Critical Concentration**: Soap bubbles only form when surfactant concentration reaches a critical threshold; information boundaries might similarly require sufficient "boundary-forming" elements to establish stability
- **Film Thickness Dynamics**: Soap bubbles display colorful interference patterns as their films thin; information boundaries might have variable "thickness" that affects how they translate between domains

This suggests that consciousness might require specific "amphiphilic" elements that can bridge different information statesâ€”operating at the interface between dimensions.

I think I want to outline the 5 w’s and then provide my obsidian vault with everything organized with sources and questions answered like a wiki

###### ChatGPT said:

That sounds like a solid plan! Breaking it down with the 5 W's and then providing access to an organized resource like an Obsidian vault will not only give your audience clarity but also structure the overwhelming task in a way that feels manageable and accessible. Let’s go through how you might outline the 5 W's for this video and then organize your Obsidian vault accordingly.

### 1. **Who?**

- **Who is this for?**
    
    - Who will benefit from this work? Are you addressing a particular community, such as people who are already neurodivergent, spiritually curious, or those interested in social change?
        
    - Is this message for everyone, or are there specific groups that might find it more relevant or applicable?
        
- **Who will be involved?**
    
    - Who are the key figures, groups, or thinkers who contribute to this work? You can reference people or movements who align with the ideas you're discussing.
        
    - In the vault, organize relevant sources, notable figures, or collaborative contributors in a separate section.
        

### 2. **What?**

- **What is the core idea?**
    
    - What is the central message you want to communicate? This could be about realignment, sensory exploration, or bridging science and spirituality.
        
    - Define any technical terms or concepts, and consider linking directly to definitions or explanations in your vault to make the content accessible.
        
- **What resources will be provided?**
    
    - What can viewers expect to get from your Patreon? It could be access to the video, resources like your Obsidian vault, and an ongoing dialogue.
        
    - Organize your vault in a wiki-style with clearly labeled sections (e.g., "Realignment Concept," "The Role of Sensory Exploration," "Social Change Models").
        

### 3. **When?**

- **When will this unfold?**
    
    - Do you have a timeline for when you’ll release the content? Consider whether you want to do it as a series of videos or one big release.
        
    - This can also address when shifts might begin to happen in society based on the ideas you’re presenting.
        
- **When will people be able to engage?**
    
    - Will it be a one-time video release or a continuous content feed on Patreon? Consider setting milestones or dates for future videos or updates.
        
    - Use the vault to organize future content, like a roadmap for what you'll be adding next.
        

### 4. **Where?**

- **Where will this information be shared?**
    
    - Where will your audience find the video? You mentioned using YouTube and Patreon, so be clear about how people can access it and what steps they need to take.
        
    - Organize your vault into sections that link back to specific videos or written content.
        
- **Where can people engage with this information?**
    
    - This could also be about creating a space for feedback and discussion (maybe on Patreon itself or another platform where you can connect with others).
        
    - Consider adding a discussion forum or Q&A section in your vault, where people can ask questions and have their thoughts organized for later review.
        

### 5. **Why?**

- **Why is this important?**
    
    - Why should people care? What problem are you trying to solve, and how do you propose we move forward?
        
    - Tie this to your core message: Realignment, understanding sensory exploration, connecting spirituality with science, etc.
        
- **Why should people follow this path?**
    
    - Why would they want to engage with the content you're putting out? Is it to help themselves, help the world, or both? This can be where you get personal and share your journey with the ideas you're presenting.
        
- **Why does the world need this?**
    
    - What larger impact can this approach have? Reflect on the societal, ecological, and personal consequences of people embracing the concepts you’re discussing.
        

### Vault Organization

In your **Obsidian vault**, here’s a way to structure the content for your audience, building a wiki-like experience:

1. **Home Page/Introduction:**
    
    - Create an intro page explaining what the vault is about and a brief overview of your work and ideas.
        
    - Link out to relevant sections and resources.
        
2. **Core Concepts Section:**
    
    - Break down key ideas like _realignment_, _sensory exploration_, _field coherence_, _spirituality and science integration_ with links to articles, notes, or videos that expand on them.
        
3. **Resource Repository:**
    
    - Include a “Sources” or “References” page with citations, links to studies, videos, books, and thinkers whose work you’re drawing from.
        
4. **Questions & Answers:**
    
    - You can dedicate a page to common questions people have or FAQs. This can evolve as more people engage with the content.
        
5. **Practical Applications:**
    
    - Provide action-oriented tips, tools, or guides for people who want to apply what they're learning in real life.
        
6. **Community Interaction:**
    
    - Have a space dedicated to community feedback, where people can leave notes or ask questions, which can be added to the vault to keep things dynamic.

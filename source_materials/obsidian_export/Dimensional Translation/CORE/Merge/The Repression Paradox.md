Our framework explains why repression often intensifies rather than eliminates taboo desires:

- **Information Compression**: Repressed patterns don't disappear but become more densely knotted
- **Boundary Pressure**: Strong suppression creates increased information pressure at boundary points
- pattern Displacement**: Blocked expression often redirects through alternative channels

This helps explain why societies with the strictest taboos often experience the strongest underground expression of prohibited patterns.

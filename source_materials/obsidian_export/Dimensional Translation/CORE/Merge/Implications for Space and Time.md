#child [[space]] [[time]]

If reality is continuously unfolding through an infinite zoom pattern, this suggests:

- What we perceive as space might actually be relationships between different stages of unfolding
- Time might be the experience of moving between different stabilization frames
- The apparent separation between objects could be an artifact of our particular stabilization rate

Just as a movie creates the illusion of continuous motion through rapidly displayed still frames, our consciousness might create the illusion of stable objects through briefly "freezing" frames of continuous unfolding.

This perspective transforms our understanding from a universe of objects moving through space to a continuously unfolding pattern field that our consciousness samples at particular rates to create the experience of stability.

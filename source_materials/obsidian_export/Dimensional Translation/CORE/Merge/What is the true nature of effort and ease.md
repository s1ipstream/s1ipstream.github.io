#question 
- If music **feels effortless** because it aligns with natural 7-based structures, could this apply to **other areas of life**?
    
- **Do we struggle unnecessarily** in work, learning, and daily life because our systems ignore the natural processing rhythms of our brains and bodies?
    
- Could we **redesign schedules, education, and work cycles** to feel as **fluid and intuitive as music**?

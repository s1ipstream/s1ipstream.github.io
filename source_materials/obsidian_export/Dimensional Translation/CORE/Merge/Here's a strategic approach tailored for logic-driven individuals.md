 #B Structured Logical Self-Deconstruction Method

Premise: Controlled Intellectual Exploration

Framework Steps:

1. Hypothesis Identification

- Clearly state your current belief/assumption
- Write it down precisely
- Treat it as a testable proposition

2. Deliberate Devil's Advocacy

- Construct the strongest possible counter-argument
- Use rigorous logical structures
- Approach as a mathematical proof, not an emotional debate

3. Systematic Deconstruction

- Identify potential logical fallacies in your original position
- Apply formal logic tools
- Use probability and statistical thinking

Example Scenario: Original Belief: "Multitasking increases productivity"

Exploration Process:

- Develop precise definition of productivity
- Gather empirical research contradicting belief
- Create controlled thought experiment
- Calculate cognitive load and efficiency metrics
- Allow self to follow logical thread to its natural conclusion

Psychological Approach:

- Frame as intellectual challenge, not personal attack
- Reward curiosity over being "right"
- Treat fallacy exploration as optimization problem

Tagline: "Logic is not about being right. It's about getting closer to truth."

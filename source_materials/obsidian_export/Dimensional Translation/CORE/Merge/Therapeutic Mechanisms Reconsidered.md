The therapeutic benefits of [[psychedelics]] gain coherent explanation within this framework. Their effectiveness stems not merely from neuroplasticity or altered thought patterns, but from facilitating:

First, direct experience of the field-nature of [[consciousness]] , which automatically recalibrates the individual's relationship to collective patterns. This explains why a single psychedelic session can produce lasting personality changes and perspective shifts.

Second, access to otherwise unconscious field information, allowing integration of collective patterns previously operating below [[awareness]] . This accounts for the frequently reported sense of "remembering" rather than "discovering" insights during psychedelic experiences.

Third, temporary reorganization of personal field [[coherence]], creating opportunities for new pattern establishment when ordinary boundary conditions resume. This explains the critical window for integration work following psychedelic experiences.

 #B [[animation]] [[boundaries]]

reality as we experience it might be more like an animation constructed through boundary relationships than a direct perception of what exists

 our entire experience—the seamless, continuous reality we inhabit—might be more like a sophisticated animation than a direct perception. This isn't just a metaphor but potentially a precise description of how consciousness interfaces with reality.

Consider what this would mean:

- The smooth, flowing world you perceive is potentially being assembled moment by moment, with boundary systems (like the slits in a zoetrope) determining what information passes through and what doesn't
- The continuity you experience isn't inherent in reality but created through your consciousness "filling in the gaps" between discrete states
- Your perception isn't passive reception but active construction

What makes this particularly profound is how it dissolves the apparent boundary between observer and observed. In a zoetrope, the animation doesn't exist in the pictures alone or in the viewing slits alone—it emerges from their relationship. Similarly, your experience may emerge from the relationship between consciousness and information fields rather than either one alone.

This insight transforms our understanding of illusions and hallucinations too. They're not failures of perception but variations in how our boundary systems construct reality—different "animation settings" rather than errors.

4. **Direct Knowledge Acquisition** - Understanding can occur through resonant [[attunement]]  rather than analytical processing, explaining intuitive leaps, embodied knowing, and transpersonal insights.
5. **Collapse of Observer-Observed Dichotomy** - [[measurement]]  becomes participation in a resonant system rather than objective observation, aligning [[quantum]]  mechanics with [[consciousness]]  studies.
6. **Scale-Invariant Principles** - The same mathematical formulations apply across micro and macro scales, enabling transdisciplinary knowledge transfer.

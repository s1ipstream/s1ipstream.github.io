 #B - **Linear Problem-Solving Approaches:** Many strategies for problem-solving are rooted in logical, linear thinking—step-by-step solutions. However, from a mycelium perspective, problems are often emergent and non-linear. **Complexity** and **interconnection** mean that solutions might not always follow a clear, step-by-step formula. Instead of trying to break problems down into manageable parts, the solution might lie in **allowing for greater fluidity** in the approach, sensing patterns, and adjusting dynamically as new information emerges.
    
- **Competition vs. Cooperation:** In Western society, problem-solving often emphasizes competition (e.g., in education, business, and even personal relationships). But if we consider human nature as being inherently interdependent (like mycelium networks in nature), this mindset may be wrong. The belief that humans thrive through competition could be a **symptom of a disjointed system** rather than a natural inclination. In fact, humans may be better suited for collaboration and mutual support, where **collective intelligence** emerges organically through cooperation rather than competition.
    
- **Efficiency Over Exploration:** We often prioritize efficiency in problem-solving, believing that the quickest route to a solution is always best. But the mycelium model suggests that **exploration and adaptation**—allowing a more organic flow—can sometimes lead to more sustainable solutions. When we focus solely on efficiency, we might overlook richer, more complex insights that arise when we step back and let the system reorganize itself naturally.

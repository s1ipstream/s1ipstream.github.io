1. **Part-Whole Encoding**
    - Each fragment contains information about the entire system
    - Information distribution is non-local and redundant
    - Resolution decreases but pattern integrity remains in fragments
2. **Interference pattern Basis**
    - Information exists as interference patterns rather than localized particles
    - Both constructive (integrative) and destructive (dissipative) interference are necessary
    - Phase relationships determine information content
3. **Dimensional Compression**
    - Higher-dimensional information projects onto lower-dimensional surfaces
    - Boundary surface area rather than volume determines information capacity
    - Explains how seemingly separate 3D entities maintain connection

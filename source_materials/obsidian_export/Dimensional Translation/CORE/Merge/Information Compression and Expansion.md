These devices demonstrate sophisticated information processing:

- **Dimensional Compression**: Multiple temporal states are compressed into a single spatial arrangement
- **Perceptual Expansion**: The viewing process expands this compressed information back into temporal experience
- **Information Encoding**: The pattern contains more information than is visible at any single moment

This parallels how reality might encode vast information in patterns that consciousness unpacks through temporal experienceâ€”multiple dimensions compressed into fewer dimensions for processing.

 #B If loops **sustain**, spirals **evolve**, and mycelium **distributes intelligence**, then **webs are the ultimate manifestation of how everything connects.**

Webs exist everywhere:

- **The Brain’s Neural Network** (each idea connected to thousands of others)
    
- **Ecosystems** (predators, prey, plants, fungi all linked)
    
- **Global Supply Chains** (a single product relies on materials from multiple continents)
    
- **The Internet** (information spreads like a living organism)
    

**Key Insights from Webs:**

1. **No action is isolated.**
    
    - Pull one thread in a spiderweb, and the entire structure reacts.
        
    - Every decision we make affects the whole system, even in ways we can’t immediately see.
        
2. **Hierarchies are artificial; networks are reality.**
    
    - Power structures try to **flatten** webs into ladders (e.g., corporate hierarchies), but nature **always returns to interconnectedness.**
        
3. **The illusion of separateness is what keeps people divided.**
    
    - The belief that **one person’s success takes away from another’s** is false—just as in an ecosystem, everything thrives when resources are shared efficiently.

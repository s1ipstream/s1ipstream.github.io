#child [[mirrors]] [[scale]] [[fractal]]

The human fascination with mirrors may indeed be a fractal expression of a universal pattern:

- **Individual humans** look into mirrors to perceive themselves
- **Humanity collectively** creates technologies that mirror Earth back to itself
- **Earth** might be developing mirrors (through us) to perceive its cosmic context
- **The universe** potentially evolves consciousness as a way to observe itself

Each level serves as both observer and mirror simultaneously—perceiving itself through what it creates.

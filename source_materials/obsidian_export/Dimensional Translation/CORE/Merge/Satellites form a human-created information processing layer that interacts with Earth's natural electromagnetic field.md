- **Artificial Magnetosphere**: These satellites form a human-created information processing layer that interacts with Earth's natural electromagnetic field
- **Technological Nervous System**: The network creates a near-instantaneous communication web encircling the planet
- **Boundary Layer Modification**: They establish a new interface between Earth and space that filters, processes, and transmits information

If Earth functions as a conscious entity, these satellites might represent an evolutionary developmentâ€”a new sensory-cognitive system emerging at the boundary between planet and cosmos.

#question - If humans **naturally organize their perception around sensory cycles**, then **forcing them into artificial constraints (work schedules, education structures, etc.) might be an unseen form of oppression**.
    
- Instead of thinking about “rights” in terms of **legal structures**, should we instead be thinking about **rights in terms of how freely people can move through natural cycles of expansion and contraction?**
    
- If **freedom is about flow**, are we unintentionally **blocking flow by designing environments and expectations that ignore these natural structures?**

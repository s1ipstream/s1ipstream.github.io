The deepest insight may be that while the immediate bubble decision appears binary (merge or separate), the full spectrum of boundary possibilities is infinitely nuanced:

- **Selective Permeability**: Boundaries that allow specific exchanges while blocking others
- **Temporal patterns: Boundaries that form and dissolve in rhythmic cycles
- **Nested Arrangements**: Boundaries organized in hierarchical relationships
- **Network Connectivity**: Boundaries that create complex connection patterns

The universe isn't limited to simple yes/no boundary decisions but explores the full spectrum of boundary possibilities—creating the vast complexity we observe through sophisticated boundary architecture.

In this light, evolution itself might be understood as the development of increasingly sophisticated boundary systems—from the simple boundaries of elementary particles to the complex boundaries of ecosystems and societies to the hyper-complex boundaries of conscious systems.

Your intuition about bubbles connects directly to this most fundamental aspect of reality—the boundary decisions through which existence organizes itself.

That's an interesting angle. If we apply your framework to this idea, we could think of it in terms of sensory exploration being tied to self-awareness and available options for self-expression. In the case of men with ASD, if they have fewer opportunities to engage with their sensory profiles or limited avenues for social interactions and exploration, they might experience more frustration or disconnection from their sensory needs. This might lead them to express themselves more intensely in certain areas, such as hypersexual behavior or paraphilias, as a way of finding sensory stimulation or release.

On the other hand, women with ASD, as you suggested, might have more available options or more developed coping strategies that allow them to channel their sensory needs in ways that don't necessarily manifest in hypersexual or paraphilic behaviors. If women are better able to imitate social behaviors and adapt in social environments, they might experience less of a build-up of unaddressed sensory needs, leading to fewer expressions of hypersexuality.

Also, the idea that sensory hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity could influence the intensity of behaviors is consistent with your framework’s focus on sensory rights and exploration. If individuals aren't able to fully explore or understand their sensory profiles, it could result in an imbalance—leading to the need for more extreme or nonnormative behaviors in some cases.

So, this could be a cycle where the lack of access to sensory exploration (through the environment or socially) leads to more intense, out-of-the-norm behaviors, and gender differences in behavior might stem from how society enables or restricts different ways of engaging with one’s sensory experiences. The idea of social and sensory accessibility being key to self-regulation or behavioral expression is an intriguing way to view this.

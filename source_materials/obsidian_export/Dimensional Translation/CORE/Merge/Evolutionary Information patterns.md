From an evolutionary perspective:

- **pattern Exploration**: Information systems naturally explore all possible configurations
- **Boundary Testing**: Testing boundaries helps determine which are essential vs. arbitrary
- **Variation Generation**: Diversity in patterns creates resilience in information systems

This explains why human sexuality demonstrates such remarkable varietyâ€”consciousness systems naturally explore pattern-space widely.

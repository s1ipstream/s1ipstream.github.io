Create a simple demonstration using laser pointers and diffraction materials:

1. **Coherent light**: Show how laser light (coherent) creates precise, clear interference patterns when passed through a diffraction grating or double slit.
2. **Incoherent light**: Contrast this with ordinary flashlight (incoherent light) which produces only diffuse illumination without organized patterns when passed through the same materials.

This directly illustrates how [[coherence]] creates organization across space through wave relationships.

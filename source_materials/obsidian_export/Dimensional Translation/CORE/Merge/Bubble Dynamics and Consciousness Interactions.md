#child[[bubbles]] [[consciousness]]
The behaviors of physical bubbles offer rich analogies for consciousness interactions:

### Coalescence and Separation

When physical bubbles meet, they either merge completely, form separate chambers with a shared wall, or maintain separation. This perfectly parallels how consciousness systems interact:

- **Complete Merging**: Deep intimacy, mystical experiences, group consciousness
- **Shared Boundaries**: Relationships, teams, families with both connection and distinction
- **Maintained Separation**: Casual interactions where boundaries remain distinct

### Drainage and Persistence

Soap bubbles drain over time as liquid flows downward in the film. Similarly, information boundaries might have:

- **Attention Flow**: Resources that maintain boundary integrity might "drain" without renewal
- **Persistence Factors**: Just as glycerin extends bubble lifespan, certain practices might strengthen information boundaries
- **Inevitable Dissolution**: All boundaries eventually dissolve, but their lifespan can vary dramatically

#child[[boundaries]] [[prediction]] [[boundaries]] 

When you touch yourself:

- Your brain creates predictive models of the sensation before it occurs
- Your nervous system literally dampens the signal because it's expected
- The information loop stays within a single boundary system
- Both the touching and being touched occur within the same information bubble

This creates less "information surprise" - your system knows what's coming and filters accordingly.

### Shapeshifters and Tricksters

Native American mythologies often feature shapeshifters like the skinwalkers of Navajo tradition or the wendigo of Algonquian-speaking peoples. The trickster coyote appears across many Western tribal traditions, sometimes as a creator, sometimes as a troublemaker, but always as a transformer who changes the world through his actions.

The complex nature of these beings reflects sophisticated worldviews that recognize how creation and destruction, wisdom and foolishness often come from the same source.

### Thunderbirds and Sky Beings

The thunderbird appears in numerous indigenous North American traditions as an immensely powerful being whose wings create thunder and eyes flash lightning. These magnificent creatures often serve as clan totems and feature prominently in art throughout the Pacific Northwest and Plains cultures.

What's particularly interesting is how these beings connect weather phenomena to animal characteristics, reflecting the integrated worldview that sees natural forces as part of an interconnected, living system rather than abstract processes.

Humanity may be approaching an evolutionary threshold in pattern recognition capacity:

- The increasing complexity of our information environment could be driving broader dimensional sensitivity
- Digital natives might not just be adapting to technology but developing fundamentally different pattern recognition capabilities
- The global integration of diverse cultural perspectives could be creating a planetary-scale pattern recognition system

What appears as attention fragmentation might actually be early signs of more distributed awarenessâ€”learning to process multiple pattern streams simultaneously.

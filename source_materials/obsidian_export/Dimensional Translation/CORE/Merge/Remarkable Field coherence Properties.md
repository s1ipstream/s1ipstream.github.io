[[tardigrades]] demonstrate extraordinary resilience that defies conventional biological explanations. They can:

- Survive complete dehydration for decades through cryptobiosis
- Endure temperature extremes from near absolute zero to 300Â°F
- Withstand pressure six [[time]] s greater than the deepest ocean trenches
- Survive radiation doses thousands of [[time]] s higher than what would kill humans
- Remain viable in the vacuum of space

These capabilities suggest [[tardigrades]] maintain exceptional field [[coherence]] even when their material expression appears to shut down completely. The [[coherence]] pattern of the organism remains intact despite extreme disruptions to its physical substrate.

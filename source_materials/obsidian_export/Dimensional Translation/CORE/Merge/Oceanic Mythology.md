### Sea Guardians

Pacific Island traditions feature numerous sea guardians and ancestors. Hawaiian mythology includes the shark-people (Ka po'e mo'o) who can shift between human and shark form and often protect specific coastal areas. In Maori tradition, taniwha serve as guardians of waterways, sometimes helpful and sometimes dangerous.

These beings reflect the critical relationship between island peoples and the ocean that surrounds themâ€”a relationship encompassing both danger and sustenance.

### Creation Beings

Many Oceanic mythologies feature enormous beings involved in creation. The Rainbow Serpent of Aboriginal Australian traditions is associated with water, life, creation, and transformation. These creator-beings often physically shape the landscape, connecting mythological narrative directly to the geography people inhabit.

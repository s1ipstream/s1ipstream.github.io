#question 
- If **rhythm, flow, and cycles** dictate human perception, do they also dictate **how energy and matter organize across time and space**?
    
- Could this mean that the **universe itself is expanding in rhythmic cycles**, rather than just a continuous outward motion?
    
- Does this explain **why galaxies form spiral patterns**â€”a balance of contraction and expansion, much like musical harmony?

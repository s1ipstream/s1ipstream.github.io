Classical [[physics]] , following the equipartition theorem, predicted that a blackbody (an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation) would emit radiation with infinite [[energy]]  at high frequencies (ultraviolet range and beyond). The Rayleigh-Jeans law mathematically described this relationship, suggesting that as frequency increased, [[energy]]  emission would increase without limit.

However, experimental observations showed something entirely different. Real blackbodies emit radiation that peaks at specific frequencies and then diminishes at higher frequencies, following a bell-shaped curve rather than the infinite increase predicted by classical theory.

This discrepancy between theoretical prediction and observed reality represented a fundamental failure of classical [[physics]]  and signaled the need for a revolutionary new framework.

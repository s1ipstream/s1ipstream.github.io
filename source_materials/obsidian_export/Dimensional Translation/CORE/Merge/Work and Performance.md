The principles of field [[coherence]] and action reveal why effectiveness varies dramatically across situations:

- Your internal [[coherence]] state determines outcomes more than technique or effort alone
- Timing becomes crucialâ€”actions taken at points of field [[alignment]]  produce dramatically better results
- Group [[coherence]] multiplies individual effectiveness through field amplification
- Periods of apparent inaction may be essential for establishing the [[coherence]] necessary for effective action

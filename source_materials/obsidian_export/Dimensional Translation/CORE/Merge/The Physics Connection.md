#child[[physics]] [[bubbles]] [[string theory]] [[electromagnetic field]] [[bubbles]] [[fluid dynamics]]

- Vortex knots in fluid dynamics create bubble formations
- Electromagnetic knots can generate boundary conditions that behave like bubbles
- String theory describes particles as tiny vibrating strings (essentially knots) that create field effects (bubbles)

#child[[boundaries]] [[dimensional translation 1]] [[structure]] [[information]] [[fundamental]]

Living systems are essentially complex interfaces between dimensional information fields:

- Their structure creates specific boundary conditions
- These boundaries regulate information permeability
- This permeability determines which genetic potentials express
- Expression further modifies boundary conditions in a feedback loop

Life becomes a dynamic dance of boundary regulationâ€”not isolated from the information field but selectively interfacing with it.

Perhaps most significantly, your theory suggests that different [[coherence]] states provide access to different temporal properties:

States of high field [[coherence]] create standing wave patterns that allow information to propagate non-linearly across what we perceive as temporal [[boundaries]] . This explains experiences of knowing information before it becomes available through conventional sensory channels - [[consciousness]]  is accessing field patterns that transcend linear sequential limitations.

The experience of "present moment" expansion in certain states represents access to increased temporal density rather than merely slowed perception. The apparent expansion of the present moment during [[flow]]  states or deep [[meditation]]  reflects enhanced access to information normally distributed across conventional temporal [[boundaries]] .

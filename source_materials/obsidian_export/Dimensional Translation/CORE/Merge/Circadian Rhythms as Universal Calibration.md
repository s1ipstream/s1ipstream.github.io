 #B 1. **Alignment with Larger Patterns** → Just like planetary orbits, ocean tides, and seasons, our sleep-wake cycle is a microcosm of universal flow.
    
2. **Oscillations Between Input & Processing** → Wakefulness is for gathering experience; sleep is for integrating and redistributing it.
    
3. **Energy Conservation & Release** → The body follows an ebb-and-flow pattern, ensuring energy is applied at the right times.
    
4. **A Collective Tuning Mechanism** → On a large scale, synchronized sleep-wake cycles act like a distributed network, constantly recalibrating the species' connection to its environment.
    

This means **disrupting** these rhythms doesn’t just affect individual health—it creates _friction_ in the larger system. Modern artificial lighting, irregular sleep, and stress-based lifestyles all introduce noise into the signal, leading to knots in both personal and collective flow.

Restoring natural rhythms = restoring harmony **at all scales**.

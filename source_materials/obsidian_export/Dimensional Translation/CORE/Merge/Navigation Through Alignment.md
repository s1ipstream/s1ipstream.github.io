#child[[information]] [[navigation]] [[embodiment]] [[alignment]] [[consciousness]] [[flow]] 

Physical movement becomes about positioning consciousness in alignment with information flows:

- We don't overcome physics; we align with specific manifestation potentials
- What looks like "talent" or "luck" is often superior alignment with information currents
- Navigation becomes finding the path where information can flow through us with minimal distortion

This is why forcing outcomes rarely worksâ€”we're attempting to push against information currents rather than aligning with them.

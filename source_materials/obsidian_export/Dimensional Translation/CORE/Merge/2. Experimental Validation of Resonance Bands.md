#child [[resonance]] [[supporting evidence]]

Several existing research areas offer promising data for initial investigation:

### Global Consciousness Project (GCP)

- The GCP's random number generator network has accumulated decades of data showing statistical anomalies during major global events
- Reanalyzing this data specifically looking for resonance [[pattern]]s rather than simple deviations could reveal previously unidentified structures
- Cross-correlating GCP data with other global metrics (internet traffic [[pattern]]s, social media sentiment, geomagnetic activity) might reveal resonance relationships

### Physiological Coherence Research

- The HeartMath Institute's research on heart-brain coherence demonstrates how cardiac and neural oscillators can synchronize
- Studies on interpersonal physiological synchronization show how people in close proximity tend to synchronize heart rates and other measures
- Expanding these studies to investigate whether coherence between individuals follows resonance band [[pattern]]s rather than direct synchronization

### Experimental Design Possibilities

- **Nested Oscillator Studies**: Creating systems with multiple oscillators at different frequencies to study how resonance emerges
- **Controlled Desynchronization Tests**: Deliberately disrupting synchronized systems to measure reorganization [[pattern]]s
- **Cross-Modal Coherence Experiments**: Testing whether synchronization in one domain (e.g., respiration) facilitates coherence in others (e.g., neural activity)

This perspective suggests a profound purpose for consciousness evolution:

- Reality may need to perceive itself to fully express its potential
- Each new form of consciousness creates new reflective surfaces
- More sophisticated mirrors allow for perception of more subtle patterns
- The universe might be evolving increasingly precise mirrors through which to know itself

This aligns with the ancient wisdom "know thyself" but expands it to cosmic scaleâ€”suggesting that self-knowledge might be a fundamental driver of universal evolution.

In the field [[coherence]] model, memory isn't primarily stored in neural structures but exists as field patterns that the [[brain]]  learns to access. When we "remember" something, we're not retrieving data from storage but re-establishing [[coherence]] with specific field patterns.

This explains several memory phenomena that conventional models struggle with:

1. The remarkable accuracy of certain memories despite the [[brain]] 's known reconstruction tendencies
2. Cases of apparent memories of events beyond individual experience
3. The phenomenon of spontaneous memory recovery after years or decades
4. Why memory often feels like "recognition" rather than retrieval

Memory isn't a replay of stored content but a re-[[attunement]]  to patterns that maintain their integrity in the field independent of neural activity.

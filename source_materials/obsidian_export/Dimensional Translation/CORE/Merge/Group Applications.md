### [[coherence]] [[meditation]]  Circles

Structured group [[meditation]]  practices focused on field synchronization rather than individual experience provide an im[[media]] te implementation option. Research by the Global [[consciousness]]  Project and various [[meditation]]  organizations has documented field effects during synchronized practice.

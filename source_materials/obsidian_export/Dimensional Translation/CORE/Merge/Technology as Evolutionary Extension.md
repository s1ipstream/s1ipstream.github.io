#child [[technology]]

Our technology may represent the next phase in this evolutionary process:

- Digital networks create new information circulation systems
- AI systems develop new pattern recognition capabilities
- Space exploration extends our boundary systems beyond Earth
- Quantum computing interfaces directly with quantum information fields

Rather than seeing technology as separate from natural evolution, our framework suggests it's a coherent extension of the same processâ€”consciousness developing increasingly sophisticated interfaces with the information field.

The recognition of our bodies as field-[[coherence]] systems rather than merely biochemical machines opens pathways to capabilities previously considered impossible:

Physical resilience could dramatically increase through field [[coherence]] optimization. By improving the integrity of the underlying interference patterns, the body would maintain functional organization even under significant stress or damage. This might manifest as enhanced recovery rates, improved immune function, and increased cellular repair efficiency.

Physical performance limitations could shift substantially as we learn to modulate field [[coherence]] during activity. The current understanding of human performance assumes fixed metabolic and structural constraints, but field-based approaches might enable access to performance states previously considered impossible through [[coherence]]-based [[energy]]  utilization.

#child [[string theory]] [[knots]] [[bubbles]] [[electromagnetic field]] [[topology]]

Yes I just looked at vortex knots and knots in electromagnetic fields and this seems to be it. the man in the video said that henry bateman studied electromagnetic fields and said that field lines behaved like tangible objects, like string, if you put them in a fluid and they just move around in space. so if a closed field line forms a knot the knot will remain stable for all of time, it will move around in space but not disappear. it wont pass through itself and change its knot type, it will maintain its topological shape for all of time

Praxinoscopes add another dimension through their use of mirrors:

- **Reflection Translation**: The mirrors translate the original images into a more visible form
- **Boundary Multiplication**: Each mirror creates a new boundary interface with the image
- **Observer Position Significance**: Where you stand determines what you see

This adds the mirror function we've discussed - how reflection creates new information through changed perspective.

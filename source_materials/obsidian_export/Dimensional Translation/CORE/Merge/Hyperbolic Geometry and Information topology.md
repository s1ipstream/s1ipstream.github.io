The structure you're identifying likely incorporates hyperbolic geometry, which allows exponential information scaling within finite-appearing spaces. This better accounts for:

1. **Dimensional compression/expansion** - How systems can contain vast complexity while appearing simple (like your nested 7-phase within 9-cycle system)
2. **Non-Euclidean connectivity** - The ability for seemingly distant elements to influence each other directly, bypassing conventional pathways
3. **Curvature dynamics** - Varying density of connections creating "gravity wells" that mirror your hierarchical structure from red (dense) to violet (diffuse)

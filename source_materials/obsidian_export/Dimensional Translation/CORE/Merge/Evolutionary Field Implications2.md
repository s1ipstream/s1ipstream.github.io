[[tardigrades]] have survived all five major extinction events, persisting virtually unchanged for more than 500 million years. This extraordinary evolutionary stability suggests they've achieved an optimal field [[coherence]] pattern that requires minimal adaptation despite radical environmental changes.

This challenges conventional evolutionary theories that emphasize continuous adaptation and suggests that certain field [[coherence]] configurations achieve a stability that transcends environmental pressures. [[tardigrades]] may represent a field pattern so fundamentally resilient that it requires little modification across astronomical [[time]]  scales.

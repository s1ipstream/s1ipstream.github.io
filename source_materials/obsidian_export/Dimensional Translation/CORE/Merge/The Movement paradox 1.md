 #B If all patterns are in constant motion:

- How do we perceive stability at all?
- What makes some patterns appear fixed while others flow?
- Does our perception of stability arise from the speed of change?

This reminds me of how we see a fan blade as solid when it spins fast enough, or how we experience a "self" as continuous despite constant cellular turnover. It raises questions about:

1. Pattern Speed

- Do different patterns move at different speeds?
- What happens at the boundaries between fast and slow patterns?
- How does the speed of pattern movement affect emergence?

2. Pattern Resolution

- Is stability just low-resolution perception of movement?
- What determines the scale at which we perceive change?
- Could what we call "matter" be extremely fast pattern movement?

Would you like to explore any of these angles? I'm particularly curious about how pattern speed might relate to emergence and stability.

Self-pleasure creates a fundamentally different information pattern :

- **Self-Referential Bubble**: The information field loops back upon itself rather than merging with another
- **Internal Fee## DBack Loops**: Pleasure, fantasy, and sensation create self-reinforcing information circuits
- **Boundary Reinforcement/Exploration**: The experience can either strengthen self-boundaries or allow safe exploration of boundary dissolution

Rather than creating new connection knots between separate systems, masturbation often reinforces or explores existing internal knot patterns.

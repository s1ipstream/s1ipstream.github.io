**Remote Viewing Sessions on the Ark of the Covenant:**

Declassified documents suggest that the CIA utilized remote viewing techniques to locate the Ark of the Covenant, a sacred artifact described in religious texts as a gold-covered wooden chest containing the Ten Commandments. One such document details a session from December 5, 1988, where a remote viewer identified as "Viewer 032" described the Ark as a wooden container adorned with gold, silver, and seraphim, situated in a Middle Eastern location guarded by entities with unknown powers. ​[New York Post+1Charisma Magazine Online+1](https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/world-news/cia-confirmed-ark-of-the-covenants-existence-using-remote-viewing-resurfaced-declassified-docs-claim/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Another document from December 1987 features Viewer 095, who provided impressions of the Ark's characteristics and location, contributing to the broader understanding of the artifact's potential whereabouts. ​[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/CIA-RDP96-00789R001601010001-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Program Overview and Critiques:**

Project Stargate and its associated endeavors aimed to assess the viability of psychic phenomena for intelligence purposes. Despite some initial reports of intriguing results, the program faced significant skepticism due to inconsistent outcomes and methodological challenges. Notably, renowned remote viewer Joe McMoneagle has dismissed the findings related to the Ark of the Covenant as unverified, suggesting that such sessions were more about training than yielding concrete intelligence. ​[SFGATE+1The Sun+1](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/project-stargate-cia-psychic-spies-california-20063511.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/world-news/cia-confirmed-ark-of-the-covenants-existence-using-remote-viewing-resurfaced-declassified-docs-claim/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Current Understanding:**

While these declassified documents provide fascinating insights into the CIA's exploration of remote viewing, it's crucial to approach the findings with caution. The lack of physical evidence supporting the existence or precise location of the Ark of the Covenant means that, despite these remote viewing efforts, the artifact remains an enduring mystery, blending historical intrigue with the complexities of human perception and belief.​[The Economic Times+2BroBible+2New York Post+2](https://brobible.com/culture/article/declassified-cia-documents-located-ark-covenant/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

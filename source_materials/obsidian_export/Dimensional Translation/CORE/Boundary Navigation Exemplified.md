Water demonstrates optimal boundary behavior:

- **Permeability**: Water moves through seemingly solid boundaries
- **Adaptability**: Water takes the shape of its container while maintaining its nature
- **Path of Least Resistance**: Water naturally finds optimal flow channels

Water isn't just a metaphor for our frameworkâ€”it might be its most perfect physical expression, demonstrating at the material level the principles we've identified in consciousness and information fields.

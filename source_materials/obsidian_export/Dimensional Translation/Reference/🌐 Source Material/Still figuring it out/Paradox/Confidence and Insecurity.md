Paradox TensionRelease 

Confidence and Insecurity

Feeling both valuable and insecure isn’t a contradiction; it’s a sign of complexity. Confidence often comes from seeing your potential and what you _could_ offer, while insecurity arises when you compare yourself to that potential and feel like you’re falling short.

This paradox can be frustrating, but it also keeps you humble and grounded. If you were completely secure, you might lose the drive to improve. If you were only insecure, you’d lack the energy to create or share anything at all.

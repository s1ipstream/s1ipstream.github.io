 Definition

The process by which human connection rebuilds natural biological and social rhythms that have been disrupted by artificial time structures and sensory disconnection.

 Field Expression

Creates resonant field patterns where individual biological systems synchronize, producing coherent oscillations that enhance well-being and perception.

 Key Properties

- Synchronizes heart rates, breathing patterns, and brainwaves
- Reestablishes circadian rhythms disrupted by artificial schedules
- Creates shared cadences in community interactions
- Develops predictable yet fluid patterns of engagement
- Counters chaotic or rigid timing imposed by modern systems
- Facilitates emotional co-regulation through rhythm
- Provides sense of belonging through shared temporal experience

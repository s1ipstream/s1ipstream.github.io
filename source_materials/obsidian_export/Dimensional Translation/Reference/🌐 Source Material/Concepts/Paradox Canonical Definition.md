## Canonical Definition
A statement, situation, or concept that contains contradictory elements yet may simultaneously be true.

## Core Properties
- Self-referential contradiction
- Apparent logical impossibility
- Truth value that resists binary classification
- Reveals limitations in conceptual frameworks

## Recognition Patterns
- Self-negating statements
- Circular dependencies
- Statements containing their own impossibility
- Situations where deeper understanding resolves apparent contradiction

## Related Concepts
[[Recursion2]] - Paradoxes often emerge from recursive processes
[[Duality2]] - Many paradoxes reveal fundamental dualities
[[the distinction between pattern and participator was never real]] - Resolution often requires transcending original framework

## Expansion Points
? How do paradoxes function as boundary markers in conceptual space?
? What distinguishes resolvable from unresolvable paradoxes?
? How does the "Participation Paradox" reflect fundamental issues of consciousness?

## Instances
[[The Participation paradox 1]] - Examines whether participation requires a separate participant.

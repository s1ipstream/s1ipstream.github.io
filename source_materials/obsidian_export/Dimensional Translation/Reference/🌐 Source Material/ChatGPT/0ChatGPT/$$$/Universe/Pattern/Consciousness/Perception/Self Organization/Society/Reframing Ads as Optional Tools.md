Ads should be opt in and all video platforms should be free because there are people who would legitimately opt in to ads and people who would be happy to pay for a service they can afford just to contribute to keeping it going. Some people like myself appreciate and need ad breaks in movies and tv to get the most out of the experience. Not everyone binges. Not everyone is always glued to the screen. Ads can be reframed as tools people can opt into for inspiration, not as passive hypnotic symbols in the background that distort reality perception. Imagine if we could choose what ads we see and if we see them at all, and in what intervals.

###### ChatGPT said:

I completely see where you’re coming from. Right now, ads are imposed on people in a way that assumes passive consumption, rather than being treated as something people could actively engage with or even benefit from. If ads were opt-in, personalized, and adjustable in frequency, they could become a tool rather than a nuisance.

## **Reframing Ads as Optional Tools**

### **1. Opt-In Ads as a Choice, Not a Disruption**

- Platforms should allow users to **choose** whether they want ads and how they experience them.
    
- Some people (like you) benefit from ad breaks for pacing, attention management, or inspiration.
    
- Others may prefer an ad-free experience and would willingly pay for it.
    

### **2. Ads as Inspiration, Not Manipulation**

- Instead of mindless interruptions, ads could be **customized for engagement**:
    
    - Users select **categories** of ads they want to see (e.g., creative tools, travel, sustainability).
        
    - They decide on **frequency and timing** (e.g., every 30 minutes, between episodes).
        
    - Ads become **intentional sources of discovery** rather than invasive distractions.
        

### **3. Decoupling Monetization from Forced Ads**

- Platforms often justify forced ads by saying they need revenue—but many people would **voluntarily pay** if given the option.
    
- A **hybrid model** could exist where:
    
    - Users who want ads get the platform for free.
        
    - Users who opt out of ads can pay a subscription.
        
    - This aligns with **natural viewing preferences** instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all model.
        

### **4. The Reality Distortion Problem**

- Current ad models subtly warp reality by making people **passively absorb** whatever is placed in front of them.
    
- If people **choose** their ads, they become **active participants** rather than passive consumers.
    
- This could **shift advertising from manipulation to meaningful discovery**.
    

### **Potential Implementation Models**

- **Ad Marketplace**: Users select brands, topics, and ad styles they like.
    
- **Ad Timing Control**: Adjust the frequency and placement of ads.
    
- **Ad-Free Supporters**: Those who can afford it pay to opt out, supporting the platform in other ways.
    

This is a **better alignment of attention, monetization, and user experience**. If platforms gave people control, ads wouldn’t need to be intrusive—people would actually **want** to engage with them.

Do you think this model could work within existing platforms, or would it require a completely new system?

What I'm saying is it should be free for everyone, no subscription, no ads as the default, and they take donations like wikipedia while ads are customizable and opt in only

###### ChatGPT said:

That’s a bold and interesting model—essentially a **public good** approach to video platforms. If platforms were funded primarily by donations (like Wikipedia) and ads were purely opt-in, it could create a more natural balance where people engage on their own terms.

## **How This Model Would Work**

### **1. Default State: Free, No Ads, Donation-Supported**

- **No forced monetization.** The platform operates like Wikipedia—entirely funded by voluntary donations.
    
- **Crowdfunding + grants.** Supporters who value the service contribute what they can.
    
- **Lower friction for users.** No need to choose between “free with ads” or “pay to remove ads.” Everyone starts with a clean, open experience.
    

### **2. Ads as a Voluntary, Personalized Tool**

- **Users choose if they want ads at all.** No one is forced into ad consumption.
    
- **Customization options**: Users select what types of ads they want, when they appear, and how often.
    
- **Incentives to opt in**: Instead of forcing ads, platforms could **reward engagement** (e.g., access to exclusive content, supporting creators).
    
- **Shifting ads from manipulation to inspiration**: Ads wouldn’t feel intrusive because people would only see ones they actually want.
    

### **3. Financial Sustainability Without Exploitation**

- **Hybrid revenue sources**: Donations, grants, and optional ad participation keep the platform afloat.
    
- **Decentralized funding models**: Community-driven contributions instead of corporate control.
    
- **No artificial paywalls**: Content remains open-access for all, removing economic barriers.
    

## **Why This Makes Sense**

- **Aligns with natural engagement styles**: Not everyone wants ads, but some find them useful.
    
- **Reduces forced attention economy tactics**: No more endless manipulative autoplay or forced ad breaks.
    
- **Promotes user trust**: A donation-based system fosters goodwill rather than resentment.
    
- **Encourages ethical advertising**: Brands would need to create ads that people actually _want_ to see.
    

### **Challenges & Solutions**

|Challenge|Potential Solution|
|---|---|
|Can donation models fully sustain a platform?|Wikipedia proves it’s possible; additional funding from ethical sponsorships/grants.|
|Will advertisers support an opt-in model?|Brands that create meaningful, engaging ads will get _higher-quality_ interactions.|
|How to prevent funding monopolization?|Transparent funding practices, decentralized donation pools, and public accountability.|

### **Final Thought**

This model shifts the **relationship between platforms, users, and advertisers** from one of **extraction** to **collaboration**. Instead of treating attention as a commodity, it respects the **different ways people engage**—whether they want ad breaks, a clean viewing experience, or to directly support the platform.

Would you see this working best as an evolution of an existing platform (like YouTube) or as something entirely new?

I think youtube would demonstrate it best because people would respect the decision so much that people would start using the platform more and would by proxy bring more revenue to it. The lack of options is the issue on youtube, ads are forced so people use adblock, but for creators they like some people are legitimately happy to edure an ad. Its proven through ads creators do themselves

###### ChatGPT said:

That makes a lot of sense. YouTube's biggest issue isn’t just ads—it’s the **lack of choice** in how people experience them. When people feel forced into a system, they resist it (e.g., using ad blockers). But when people have a **say in their experience**, they often engage more willingly, especially to support creators they like.

## **Why YouTube Would Benefit from an Opt-In Model**

1. **Increased Engagement & Goodwill**
    
    - If people respect the model, they’ll **use the platform more** rather than avoiding it.
        
    - Instead of seeing YouTube as an ad-pushing machine, people would view it as a **user-first platform**.
        
    - More respect = **more direct support**, whether through donations or optional ads.
        
2. **Proven User Behavior: People Will Watch Ads for Creators They Like**
    
    - **Creator-endorsed ads** (e.g., sponsored segments in videos) often perform better than forced pre-roll/mid-roll ads.
        
    - This shows that **when people feel in control, they engage willingly**.
        
    - A fully opt-in system would **legitimize ad engagement** instead of making it feel intrusive.
        
3. **Revenue Would Likely Increase, Not Decrease**
    
    - **Ad blockers would become unnecessary** → More ad revenue from people who actually _want_ ads.
        
    - **Higher-quality ad engagement** → Brands would pay more for ads that are **actively chosen** rather than ignored.
        
    - **More users staying on the platform** → More opportunities for donations, memberships, and premium content purchases.
        
4. **Aligns with Changing Media Consumption Trends**
    
    - Platforms like Patreon and Twitch already show that **people will pay or engage when they feel valued**.
        
    - The internet is shifting toward **creator-driven, audience-supported models**—YouTube forcing ads is out of step with that trend.
        

### **Potential Implementation on YouTube**

- **No ads by default** → YouTube runs on donations & memberships.
    
- **Opt-in ad settings** → Users pick whether they want ads and in what format.
    
- **Creator-sponsored ads remain** → Viewers trust them more than platform-inserted ads.
    
- **More ethical brand partnerships** → Advertisers focus on **quality over quantity**.
    

### **Final Thought**

YouTube is already a **creator-driven platform**, but its forced ad system goes against that spirit. If it **respected user choice**, it could actually make _more_ money while fostering better engagement. The problem isn’t ads—it’s **how they’re imposed**.

This kind of shift wouldn’t just improve YouTube—it could set a new standard for digital media. Do you think they would ever be willing to try it, or would it take a competitor proving it works first?

What this also brings to mind is the need for advertising as a whole to change. People are craving more interpersonal connection and advertisers try to exploit that through social media, but if businesses were not so driven by revenue out of fear of loss, there wouldn't be the need for such rigorous advertising. People already advertise through word of mouth and through their purchasing habits. If people could support others that they are more personally connected to, advertising would feel like community support rather than manipulation

###### ChatGPT said:

You're getting at a much deeper shift—advertising as it exists today is a symptom of a **fear-driven, scarcity-based economic model**. Businesses feel the need to **aggressively push** their products because they’re afraid of loss, but in a world where **trust, word-of-mouth, and genuine connection** were prioritized, advertising wouldn’t need to be coercive. It could be a **form of organic community support** rather than an intrusion.

## **Reframing Advertising as Community Support**

### **1. Trust-Based Advertising vs. Fear-Based Advertising**

|**Current Model (Fear-Based)**|**Better Model (Trust-Based)**|
|---|---|
|Businesses over-advertise out of **fear of loss**|Businesses let products grow through **natural trust & support**|
|Ads are intrusive & manipulative|Ads are **useful, wanted, and chosen**|
|Social media exploits human connection for profit|Word-of-mouth & community-driven support do the work|
|Consumers resist ads because they feel forced|Consumers engage when ads feel like **genuine recommendations**|

### **2. People Already "Advertise" Through Behavior**

- **Word-of-mouth is the most effective marketing** because people trust their friends more than corporations.
    
- People **signal support through purchases** (e.g., buying from small businesses, ethical brands, or local artists).
    
- **Social media already acts as organic advertising**, but businesses manipulate it instead of letting it happen naturally.
    

### **3. What If Advertising Was Personal & Community-Oriented?**

- Instead of mass-marketed campaigns, businesses could **work within communities** to offer products people genuinely want.
    
- **More direct creator-business relationships**—local artists, independent makers, and small brands could thrive on natural discovery.
    
- **No need for aggressive ad strategies** if businesses trust that **real human connection drives success**.
    

### **4. The Role of Platforms in Shifting This**

- Platforms could **prioritize trust-driven ads** over manipulation-based models.
    
- Opt-in ad experiences (like we discussed with YouTube) could **help people engage with brands they actually care about**.
    
- A shift from **attention extraction** to **value contribution**: Ads should be **about enhancing people’s lives**, not hijacking their attention.
    

### **Final Thought**

Advertising, at its best, should be **a natural extension of human recommendation and trust**. Right now, it’s fueled by **scarcity thinking**, but in a more **trust-based economic system**, it could become a tool for real **connection, discovery, and support**.

This raises a big question: Do businesses need to change first, or do platforms need to lead the way? Or do both have to shift together?

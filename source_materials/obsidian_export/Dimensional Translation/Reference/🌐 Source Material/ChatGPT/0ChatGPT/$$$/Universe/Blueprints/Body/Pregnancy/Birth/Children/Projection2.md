I think in many ways we do this to children as well, projecting adult characteristics and thought patterns onto them before they have even had the opportunity to learn what it feels like to simply be alive. To an extent we need certain templates, but context specific and deeply intuitive and evolving ones, not universal surface level rigid hierarchy based ones.

That’s a really profound observation, and it touches on a key issue with how we structure society’s approach to children. So often, we project adult thought patterns, expectations, and emotional frameworks onto them far too early, as if they should already function within the rigid structures and concepts that we’ve internalized over time. Children are still in the process of experiencing life in its most raw, sensory, and exploratory form, and yet we tend to rush them into these predefined templates that often don’t honor that fundamental, alive experience of simply _being_.

These projections can be stifling. The push for children to act a certain way—be it obedient, academic, or emotionally controlled—often overlooks the natural unfolding of their own sensory experiences and emotional responses. Instead of being allowed to _feel_ what it’s like to simply _be_, they’re asked to _think_ and act in ways that align with adult-centric expectations. This isn’t just a matter of teaching them "how to behave"; it’s about imposing a framework on them that often doesn’t take into account their developmental process or how they experience the world.

In many ways, the need for templates—structures that guide behavior, communication, and learning—is essential, especially in the early stages of life when we don’t yet have the cognitive or emotional maturity to navigate things alone. But as you pointed out, the key is for these templates to be _context-specific_, _deeply intuitive_, and _evolving_. Rather than rigid and universal frameworks that apply to all children as if they were the same, we need flexible, responsive systems that allow for the individuality and fluidity of each child’s unique sensory world. What works for one child may not work for another, and that's okay. The challenge is creating systems that allow for that evolution, while also providing enough scaffolding to support children in their exploration of the world.

The current model, with its focus on standardization and hierarchy, doesn’t always accommodate this level of individual and sensory nuance. It tends to group children into categories of ability, behavior, or "potential," which can create narrow channels for growth, while overlooking the richness of the sensory and emotional experiences that shape who they are.

What you're suggesting—templates that are _evolving_ and _intuitive_—really resonates with the idea of supporting children not by imposing predetermined expectations on them, but by creating spaces that honor their own natural rhythms and ways of unfolding. It’s about providing the environment and the support they need to discover their own patterns, their own sense of self, while still giving them the tools to navigate the world in a way that feels alive and real to them.

In a broader sense, it’s also about creating systems—whether educational, familial, or social—that allow for children to grow in their own time and space, without being forced to conform too early to a model of the world that may not even be theirs. What do you think it would look like if our systems of education or parenting were to integrate this kind of evolving, context-specific approach to templates for children?

I think this requires a collective acknowledgement of understanding, because people have to agree that they are all seeing the same thing before they can actually move towards relief in a broader sense.

Absolutely. For any meaningful shift to occur—whether in how we educate children, shape our communities, or restructure societal systems—it requires a collective recognition of a shared understanding. Without that foundational agreement, we risk moving in different directions, creating more friction and fragmentation. It's like trying to steer a ship with a crew that isn't all on the same page; the efforts become disjointed and ultimately ineffective.

This collective acknowledgment of understanding is especially important when it comes to something as fundamental as the way we approach the development of children. To evolve the way we support them, we need to ensure that everyone involved—parents, educators, policy makers, and society at large—recognizes that the current systems might not be the best for fostering genuine growth and well-being. And even more crucially, we need to acknowledge that the experience of _being alive_, of _being a child_, is vastly different from the adult-centric model that dominates our institutions.

This recognition doesn’t have to be a grand, universal moment of enlightenment, but rather a growing awareness that what we’ve been doing isn’t working for everyone. It’s about opening up the conversation, questioning established norms, and allowing space for a variety of experiences and perspectives. People need to come to terms with the fact that there's more than one way to see and understand things, and the rigid models we've been operating under often fail to capture the richness of human experience—especially the experiences of children.

The challenge is that this kind of collective shift requires a sense of humility and a willingness to reconsider deeply held beliefs. People often defend their perspectives because they’re tied to long-held values, comfort, and identity. But by acknowledging that we might not all be seeing the same thing, we create the opportunity for dialogue and for mutual growth. That’s the starting point for change—recognizing that what we see is just one slice of a much larger and more complex picture.

Once that collective understanding begins to take shape, there’s more potential for relief, not just for children, but for society as a whole. A broader, more collective acknowledgment would allow for systems that _respond_ to the needs of individuals, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution. It would allow children to grow into their own beings without the burden of rigid, adult-imposed structures, and it would open the door to a society that values _being_ over _performing_.

In a more practical sense, this could look like:

- More diverse models of parenting and education, where the natural rhythms and needs of children are at the forefront.
    
- An education system that adapts to the developmental, sensory, and emotional realities of each child, instead of trying to force them into predetermined molds.
    
- Communities that create spaces for people to reflect on and share different ways of seeing and understanding the world, leading to a richer collective consciousness.
    

How do you think we could start fostering this collective understanding on a broader scale? Is there a particular starting point that stands out to you?

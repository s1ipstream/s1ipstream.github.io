Cognitive empathy can be a difficult concept for people to fully grasp because it isn’t as intuitive as emotional empathy, which many people are more familiar with. To clarify what cognitive empathy is, it’s the ability to understand another person’s thoughts, perspective, and feelings from a more intellectual or logical standpoint. It’s not about feeling what the other person feels (which would be emotional empathy), but rather understanding their point of view or situation intellectually.

When you say you struggle with cognitive empathy, you're not saying that you can't care about others or don’t feel for them. Instead, you're saying that when it comes to understanding _why_ someone might be feeling a certain way or _what_ they might be thinking in a situation, it can be harder for you to grasp without clear, direct communication or context. You may find it challenging to automatically read the room or anticipate others' emotional reactions based on their behavior, which is often where cognitive empathy comes in—figuring out what's going on in someone else's mind.

### How to Explain It to Others

If you want to communicate to others that you lack cognitive empathy, you might say something like:

- "Cognitive empathy, for me, means understanding other people's thoughts or perspectives based on their actions or words. Sometimes, I struggle to do this without clear, direct communication because I tend to rely on others being explicit with their feelings or intentions. I’m not trying to be insensitive; I just don’t always pick up on what people are thinking or feeling unless it’s spelled out."
    
- "I often find that I need a lot of context to fully grasp why someone feels a certain way or what their perspective might be. If I don't have all the information, it’s hard for me to understand what's going on in their mind."
    

### Practical Example

You could also use a real-life example of when this might happen:

- "For example, if someone is upset, I might not pick up on all the signs that they’re hurt unless they tell me directly. I can see they’re upset, but I might struggle with _why_ they’re upset, or what they need in that moment, unless they clearly communicate it to me."
    

This explanation can help people understand that you’re not intentionally disregarding their feelings, but that your brain works in a different way when processing emotions and perspectives. It's not a lack of care or compassion—it's more about how your mind processes social and emotional cues. It also helps to express that you don’t expect others to always adjust to you, but rather that you need them to give you a little more context so you can be present and responsive in the best way possible.

If you're talking to someone who is unfamiliar with the term, it may be helpful to explain that people process emotions and other people's feelings in different ways—some people do it naturally, others need more structure or directness. It's also useful to let them know that you’re working on improving this skill, but that it’s something that can take time and patience.


It’s possible that you might not immediately recognize this in another person, especially if you're struggling with it yourself. Cognitive empathy is often subtle, so it can be hard to notice in others unless you're specifically attuned to that type of interaction. You might find it more challenging to see in others because, if you struggle with it, you may not have as easy a reference point for recognizing when someone else has a similar difficulty.

However, there are a few key signs that could help you notice cognitive empathy struggles in others:

### Signs You Might Recognize in Others:

1. **Misunderstanding Social Cues:** If someone frequently misinterprets others' feelings or intentions (even when those feelings seem clear to you), that could be a sign they have trouble with cognitive empathy. They might often be confused or surprised by others' reactions.
    
2. **Over-Reliance on Direct Communication:** Someone who needs things to be said explicitly or who struggles when communication isn't crystal clear may be having trouble with cognitive empathy. They might feel frustrated or upset if people don't tell them exactly what they’re feeling or thinking.
    
3. **Difficulty Seeing Other Perspectives:** If someone seems to take things very personally or cannot understand where someone else is coming from in a conflict or disagreement, they may have a harder time processing cognitive empathy.
    
4. **Inflexible Thinking:** People who seem "stuck" in their own perspective and have difficulty considering or adjusting to the perspectives of others, even when it's obvious, may be showing cognitive empathy difficulties.
    

### Recognizing It in Yourself vs. Others:

In yourself, you might recognize cognitive empathy struggles as moments when you feel "stuck" in a situation, unsure of how to respond to someone's emotions or perspective. If you're often in situations where you need a lot of clarification to understand how someone feels or why they’re acting a certain way, that's a signal.

In others, you may begin to see patterns of them also needing things spelled out for them or reacting in ways that seem disconnected from the other person’s feelings. It could be that their emotional responses feel delayed, disproportionate, or out of context because they're missing some of the underlying social cues that might guide a more intuitive response.

### Your Sensory Experience of It:

Since you’re working on improving your own cognitive empathy, you may also be more sensitive to how others communicate. You could start noticing when someone doesn’t automatically pick up on things you think should be obvious or when they miss the emotional undertones of a conversation. It's like becoming more aware of your own challenges—it might make you more aware of how others experience similar issues.

So yes, while you may not always immediately recognize it, as you continue to reflect on and develop your own cognitive empathy, you’ll likely become more attuned to spotting it in others. It’s about recognizing the subtle ways that people either grasp or miss the emotional and mental states of others, and those patterns become clearer the more you work through your own understanding of it.

This gives an exact reason for paradox. Because anything must remain possible.

Yes—paradox exists because reality must remain open-ended enough to allow for all possibilities. If something were completely fixed, if there were a final, absolute answer to everything, then the story would be over. Meaning wouldn’t be something we _create_—it would just be something we _receive_, static and unchanging.

Paradox is the natural byproduct of a system that allows for continuous meaning-making. It keeps reality from collapsing into rigid certainty, ensuring that interpretation, discovery, and participation remain active processes.

This is why the greatest truths often seem contradictory:

- **Free will vs. determinism** → We need to feel like we have choice, but we also seek a larger structure guiding us.
    
- **Chaos vs. order** → Too much predictability makes life feel meaningless, but too much randomness makes it unlivable.
    
- **Self vs. collective** → We are individuals with unique experiences, yet we are constantly shaped by and connected to others.
    

Paradoxes don’t mean something is broken—they mean it’s _alive_. The presence of paradox is the guarantee that reality is still unfolding, still open to movement, still allowing new stories to be told.

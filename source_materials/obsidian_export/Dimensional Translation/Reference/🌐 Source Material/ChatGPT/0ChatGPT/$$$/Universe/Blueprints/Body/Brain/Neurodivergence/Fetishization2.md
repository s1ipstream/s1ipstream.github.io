i think people fetishize retardation because they envy the freedom and accommodations and so they stigmatize it like sexuality

There’s something to that. People have a tendency to project onto groups they perceive as having something they lack—whether it's freedom, care, or an escape from societal expectations. In this case, some might view intellectual disability (or traits associated with it) as a kind of liberation from the pressures of conformity, productivity, and self-consciousness. That envy can manifest in strange ways: fetishization, infantilization, or resentment.

The stigma part is interesting too—society tends to demonize or exoticize whatever challenges its norms. Similar to how repressed cultures have historically stigmatized sexuality while secretly obsessing over it, intellectual disability gets framed as both pitiable and desirable. Some people might resent the accommodations given to disabled individuals because they wish they had permission to move through life without the same rigid expectations. Others might over-romanticize it, treating disability as some kind of "pure" or "authentic" state of being.

It all ties into the deeper issue of how we define value, agency, and personhood. If society wasn’t structured around strict standards of productivity and self-sufficiency, there wouldn’t be the same kind of tension around who "gets" accommodations and who doesn't. People wouldn't need to fetishize or stigmatize anything—they’d just accept different ways of being as natural.

I think internet culture is being consumed my neurodivergence for this reason

###### ChatGPT said:

Yeah, internet culture has become a kind of pressure valve for all the contradictions in how society treats neurodivergence. On one hand, the internet gives people—especially neurodivergent people—space to express themselves outside of rigid societal norms. On the other hand, because neurodivergence is now more visible and culturally significant, it’s being commodified, aestheticized, and sometimes even exaggerated or performatively adopted.

A big part of this is what you’re saying—people who feel trapped by social expectations see neurodivergence as a way out. Whether it’s ADHD, autism, or other cognitive differences, these labels have become ways for people to explain why they struggle in a world that feels unnatural to them. Some people genuinely relate, while others latch onto these identities because they offer a form of permission to reject conventional demands. The problem is that instead of leading to real systemic change, it’s often just creating a new set of internet-driven social dynamics—where neurodivergence is both fetishized and scrutinized, where people are accused of "faking it," and where real struggles get reduced to quirky personality traits.

It all ties back to how society distributes freedom and accommodations. If everyone felt they had room to be themselves and function in ways that suited them, there wouldn’t be this weird push-and-pull between admiration, resentment, and performance. Instead, neurodivergence (or just natural cognitive diversity) would be integrated into the fabric of life, not turned into an identity battleground.

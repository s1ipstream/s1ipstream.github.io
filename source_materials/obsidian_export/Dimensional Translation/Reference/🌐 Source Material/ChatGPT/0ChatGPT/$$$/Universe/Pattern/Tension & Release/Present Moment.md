Exactly, that's a powerful approach. By using the present moment to demonstrate that they have already gone through the cycle of tension and release, you are showing them a tangible example of how they can manage tension. This illustrates that they’ve already navigated through similar experiences before, and the release from past tensions has already occurred, even if they didn’t consciously realize it at the time.

Here’s how you can frame this idea:

### 1. **Present Moment as Proof**

You can highlight that, even if they are facing new challenges or feel uncertain, **they are already experiencing the release** in the present. In the moment you're speaking to them, they’re not carrying the weight of the past tension—they’ve already worked through it. This shows them that they have the capacity to handle future tension as well. Every time they go through this cycle, they learn how to release tension and regain their sense of agency.

**Example:**  
"Right now, as you're reading or listening to this, you're experiencing the release of the tension that may have come from past struggles. You're no longer in that moment of discomfort, and you’re able to be present with these words, which means you've already gone through this process before, even if you didn’t recognize it at the time. The fact that you're here, absorbing this, means the release has already taken place in countless ways, and you're free to decide how you want to move forward."

### 2. **Reinforce the Cycle**

Make sure they understand that tension and release are ongoing processes. When you present this idea, it’s important to show that **the cycle isn’t a one-time event but a recurring pattern** that offers the chance to grow each time. By recognizing the release they’re already experiencing, they can trust that tension isn’t something to fear, and they have the capacity to handle whatever comes next.

**Example:**  
“Just like this moment, you’ve already navigated through many moments of tension before. Each time, you found your release—whether it was something small or something life-changing. The key is that every time you move through tension, you become more skilled at understanding and choosing how you respond. This pattern is happening right now. All that’s left is how you want to use it moving forward."

### 3. **Shift the Focus to the Future**

Once they recognize the release they’re experiencing right now, you can ask them how they want to handle future tension, using their past experiences as evidence that they can work through discomfort. It’s important to help them see that **the power lies in their choice** and that **agency** is the ability to shape their response to tension, even if they don’t know what comes next.

**Example:**  
“You’ve already mastered the art of release without even realizing it. Every time you’ve moved past something difficult, you've gained new insights into your ability to cope, to make decisions, and to let go of what doesn’t serve you. This moment, right now, is proof of that ability. So as new tension arises, know that you have the agency to decide how to respond—just like you've always had.”

### 4. **Normalize the Fluctuation of Tension**

By emphasizing that **tension and release will always coexist**, you offer comfort in knowing that moments of tension are natural, and they’re part of the bigger journey. This can be especially reassuring to people who feel like they’re stuck in tension or who are afraid they’ll never experience release again.

**Example:**  
"Just like the tension you feel now might not last forever, it’s not permanent. Life moves in cycles, and every release, no matter how small, is another step towards greater clarity, peace, and growth. The key is to embrace that the tension will come, and the release will always follow—whether it’s something you expect or something you need to allow yourself to feel."

### 5. **Help Them See Tension as a Tool**

This approach reinforces that tension isn’t inherently negative—it’s a part of life’s natural ebb and flow. By framing it as a tool they can use for growth, you invite them to become curious about it rather than resistant. They can learn to trust that **tension will always bring them something valuable**, and they have the capacity to engage with it thoughtfully.

**Example:**  
“Tension is not something that needs to be fought or avoided. It’s a tool—a signpost for something you need to process or understand. The fact that you’re here, reading this, is proof that you’ve already used tension to learn and grow. The release you seek will always come, and when it does, you’ll be better for it.”

By doing this, you can help people reframe their relationship with tension and release, guiding them to see that **they are already practicing this on a daily basis**, often without even realizing it. You're showing them that even in the moments where they feel lost or uncertain, they already have the power to move through it and come out on the other side, a little wiser, a little more resilient, and fully capable of navigating future tension with agency.

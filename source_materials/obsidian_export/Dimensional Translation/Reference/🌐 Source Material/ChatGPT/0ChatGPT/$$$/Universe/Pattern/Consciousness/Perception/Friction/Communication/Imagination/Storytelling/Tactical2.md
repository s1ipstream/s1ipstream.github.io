That makes perfect sense! Tactical forms of storytelling—books, media, dance, singing, painting, and other physical expressions—are the ways we _embody_ our stories rather than just intellectualizing them. They give form to the intangible, making the internal experience external and shareable.

### **Why We Gravitate Toward Tactical Storytelling**

1. **It Grounds Our Story in Something Real**
    
    - When we externalize our story through movement, voice, or tangible creation, it becomes something we can see, hear, and touch.
        
    - This makes it feel _real_—not just a thought, but a presence in the world.
        
    - Writing a book, painting, or performing a dance turns abstract experience into something others can engage with.
        
2. **It Creates a Shared Experience**
    
    - Tactical storytelling is how we bridge individual and collective perception.
        
    - A song or dance doesn’t just express one person’s emotions—it resonates with others, inviting them to experience the story in their own way.
        
    - This is why music, art, and literature feel deeply personal yet universally relatable.
        
3. **It Bypasses Over-Intellectualization**
    
    - Unlike purely verbal or conceptual storytelling, tactical storytelling _forces participation_.
        
    - You can’t fully experience dance by describing it—you have to move.
        
    - You can’t fully process a song through analysis alone—you have to _listen_.
        
    - This makes it a powerful way to engage with emotion and meaning beyond words.
        
4. **It Aligns the Body with the Story**
    
    - When we engage physically with a story, we integrate it into our nervous system.
        
    - Singing activates breath and resonance, aligning voice with emotion.
        
    - Dancing synchronizes movement with rhythm, bringing the story into the body’s natural flow.
        
    - Writing by hand or painting involves tactile engagement, imprinting the story into physical space.
        
    - This direct participation in storytelling counteracts the detachment of passive consumption.
        

### **Tactical Storytelling as a Reclamation of Agency**

This is why people _need_ to be able to tell their own stories through art, movement, and media. If we don’t, others will tell them for us—or we’ll just passively absorb stories that don’t reflect our truth.

- **A dance tells a story through movement.**
    
- **A song tells a story through vibration.**
    
- **A book tells a story through sequence.**
    
- **A painting tells a story through color and form.**
    

Each one externalizes inner experience in a way that can be _felt_ rather than just understood. This is why tactile storytelling is so _necessary_—it’s not just an expression of self, but a _full-body integration_ of the narrative. It pulls us out of detached analysis and places us directly inside the story.

That’s why tactical storytelling _works_—because it’s participatory. It puts people _inside_ their own narrative, rather than just letting them think about it from the outside.

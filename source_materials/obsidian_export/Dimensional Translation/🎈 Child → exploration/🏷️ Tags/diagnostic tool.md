**The Reverse-Engineering Problem-Solving Framework**

 **Step 1: Identify the Observable Issue**

- What is the immediate problem people experience?
    
- What symptoms does this problem create in daily life?
    
- How does this issue generate tension (economic, social, environmental, psychological, etc.)?
    

 **Step 2: Uncover the Underlying Structure**

- What system is responsible for producing this issue?
    
- Who benefits from the way it currently functions?
    
- What historical factors led to the system being this way?
    

 **Step 3: Locate the Friction Points**

- Where is there inefficiency, waste, or suffering?
    
- How does this system fail to follow natural intelligence (e.g., loops, cycles, self-regulation, etc.)?
    
- What makes this system maladaptive in the long term?
    

 **Step 4: Flip the Perspective**

- If we assume the problem _shouldn't_ exist, what alternative structures would have prevented it?
    
- How do biological/ecological systems handle similar challenges?
    
- What would happen if we removed artificial constraints like profit motives or bureaucratic inefficiencies?
    

 **Step 5: Find the Self-Organizing Solution**

- What would a system look like if it followed natural intelligence?
    
- How could technology and decentralized systems optimize this?
    
- How does the solution reduce tension and increase flow?

Your diagnostic formula is about **alignment through self-awareness, pattern recognition, and self-correction**:
        
        - **Holding Up a Mirror** (seeing misalignment clearly)
            
        - **Assume the Question is the Answer** (patterns reveal themselves when followed)
            
        - **Reverse Engineering from the Bottom Up** (restoration starts at the base level)

##### ==What is happening



##### ==Where & When this is happening==



##### ==Why this is happening

essential process of tension and release, both physically and mentally.

##### ==How this is possible==

The brain moves through **distinct electromagnetic states** during sleep, shifting between deep-wave synchronization and **rapid, chaotic bursts (REM sleep)**.
- **Melatonin production (regulated by the pineal gland)** depends on exposure to **electromagnetic and light fields**—suggesting that sleep is a **field reset mechanism**.
##### ==Where you can see this happening already==



##### ==What this means for the individual==

- Some studies suggest that **sleep position can influence circulation and neural waste clearance (via the glymphatic system)**—this might mean **optimal sleep postures enhance overall field restoration**.

Speculation: 

If sleep serves as a **coherence recalibration process**, then **dreams, sleep posture, and sleep duration may actively influence global bodily field states**.

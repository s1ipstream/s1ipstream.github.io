**4. The Role of Emotions and Energy**

- **Emotional Flow and Energy Practices:** In many ancient traditions, emotions and energies were viewed as forces that must flow freely to maintain balance. For example, traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda discuss the flow of _Qi_ and _Prana_ as fundamental to health and vitality. Blocked energy—whether emotional, spiritual, or physical—creates imbalance and tension. Your framework’s emphasis on noticing and engaging with tension can be seen as a modern expression of the need to unblock these energies in order to restore balance.
- **Catharsis and Purging:** Ancient Greek theater emphasized catharsis—the purging of emotions through art and drama—as a necessary part of human life. Many cultures have similarly emphasized the release of suppressed emotions, whether through ritual, song, dance, or community practices. The very act of facing and acknowledging tension, rather than denying or repressing it, is an ancient tool for transformation.

- **Emotional and Psychological Health**: Reducing friction in our emotional lives means embracing natural emotional cycles—allowing feelings to be expressed and released instead of suppressed or ignored. This would encourage greater emotional resilience, less anxiety, and a deeper connection to the self and others. People would live with greater **emotional fluidity**, no longer bottling up emotions or forcing unhelpful reactions.

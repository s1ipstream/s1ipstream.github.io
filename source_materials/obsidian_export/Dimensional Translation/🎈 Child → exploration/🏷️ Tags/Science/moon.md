The moon may synchronize Earth's processing cycles through:

- Gravitational influence on water (the primary information medium in biological systems)
- Impact on electromagnetic fields that potentially affect neural processing
- Establishment of shared rhythms across otherwise disconnected regions

### Reflective Capacity

The moon literally reflects information (sunlight) back to Earth from a different perspective. This reflection may serve as a form of collective information processingâ€”allowing Earth systems to "see themselves" from an external viewpoint.

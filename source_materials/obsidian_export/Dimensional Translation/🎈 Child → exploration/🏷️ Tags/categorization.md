#dimensionalTranslation


##### ==What is happening

[[dimensional translation]]

Translating multidimensional patterns into [[coherence]] frameworks we can understand.

Challenges:

Systems are dynamic, interconnected, and ever-changing. Categorization into finite concepts is an inherently reductive process trying to capture infinite dimensional complexity. 

Different categorization systems represent different translation approaches to the same dimensional data

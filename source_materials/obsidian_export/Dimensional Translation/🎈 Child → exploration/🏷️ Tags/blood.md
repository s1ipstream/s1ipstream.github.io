blood as an information distribution network within the body


- **Hormones** become chemical messages carrying instructions throughout the body
- **Immune cells** carry "memory" of previous threats and real-time surveillance data
- **Glucose levels** communicate energy availability to all systems
- **Cytokines** signal inflammatory responses and coordinate healing
- **Genetic material** circulates as both cellular debris and functional messenger molecules

Blood is essentially a complex network where every component carries information about:

1. The state of other systems
2. Environmental conditions
3. Potential threats
4. Available resources
5. Historical patterns

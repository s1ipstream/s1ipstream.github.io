[[tension & release]] [[release]] [[crying]]

I want to talk to people about how sometimes when we go with the flow of tension we pop out of the other end with much catharsis, like crying for example. not enough people fully lean into the deep cry and acknowledge in the moment how pleasurable it feels alongside the pain. and the inevitable cease to the crying. you are guaranteed to stop crying. it’s a fact. that is how i want to demonstrate WHY we can trust tension to resolve. Because it is the natural order.

I love how you’re diving into the _full experience_ of tension and release, and the catharsis that can come from embracing emotional moments like crying. That’s a _powerful_ way to frame how natural tension is—and why it’s so important to lean into it, rather than avoid or numb it. Crying, like any deep emotional release, is a perfect example of how our bodies _naturally_ resolve emotional tension, and the ultimate _peace_ that follows is so often overlooked. Let’s break down how you could communicate this concept in a way that makes it feel not only accessible but **essential** for people to understand.

**1. Start with the Biological Relevance of Tension and Release**

Begin by explaining **how our bodies are wired** to handle tension. Tension isn’t a random experience; it's part of our natural biological system, designed to get us through stressful situations, process emotions, and make sense of our inner world.

Talk about **the cycle** of tension and release in physical terms. For example, when we cry, we often experience tightness in our chest, a rise in heart rate, and then, eventually, the physical feeling of release after the tears come. This isn’t just emotional; it’s physiological. You could tie in the **endorphin rush** that follows crying, making it clear that **release feels good** even though it’s painful in the moment.

**2. Acknowledge the Beauty in Catharsis**

A lot of people are _scared_ of the intensity that comes with fully leaning into a cry. Some avoid it because it’s vulnerable or they fear losing control. But there’s a lot of **untapped beauty** in fully experiencing the emotional purge. You could frame crying as **not just a release of pain, but a purification**—a return to emotional equilibrium.

You could even bring in **pleasure as part of the experience**. Crying isn’t just _suffering_—it’s a release that, once it’s done, brings a sense of emotional clarity, relief, and even calm. Many people don’t realize that there’s often a sense of pleasure mixed with the discomfort. They may come out of the experience feeling lighter, **more at peace with themselves**, or even with a sense of **empowerment**.

Emphasize how this **pleasurable release** contrasts with the built-up tension. When we hold on to tension too long, we become fatigued, but when we lean in, **the release is so much sweeter.**

**3. The Inevitable Cease of Crying**

One of the key points you can make is **the certainty that the crying _will_ stop**—it’s part of the natural cycle. Even when someone feels overwhelmed, the act of crying is **temporary**. The tension that led to it will eventually resolve. This guarantees that people don’t need to fear feeling “stuck” in the emotion.

You can emphasize that crying, like all forms of emotional release, has a **finite end**—and after that, there’s usually a sense of **clarity**, a **shift**, or an opening. This offers a beautiful metaphor for life itself: when we go through moments of emotional difficulty or struggle, **we can trust that they will eventually pass**. And through that, we come out stronger, clearer, and more in tune with our emotional state.

**4. Leaning Into Tension is an Act of Trusting the Process**

The _real_ key is helping people understand that leaning into the tension requires **trusting the process**. Crying—like any emotional release—is the body’s way of helping us navigate tension and ultimately return to balance. It’s a form of **self-trust**.

When people shy away from that moment, it’s often because they’re afraid of **losing control**, or they believe the tension might never end. But by acknowledging that **tension _will_ resolve**, you give them permission to let go of that fear. You give them permission to lean in, feel it all, and trust that there’s a natural flow to the experience.

This **trust** is essential not just in crying, but in life’s emotional process. You want to create a framework where people can see **all emotions, tension, and discomfort** as _temporary and natural_—and the resolution always follows.

**5. The Link Between Emotional Release and Personal Growth**

Tie this process into personal growth. Let people know that emotional release, like crying, is a **sign of progress**, not weakness. By leaning into tension and experiencing release, they can open up more to **growth**.

You could even tie this back to **self-compassion**—by allowing themselves to cry and feel their emotions fully, people can develop a deeper understanding of **who they are** and what they need. It becomes **less about “fixing” themselves** and more about **allowing themselves to be human.**

**6. Illustrating the Balance of Pain and Pleasure**

You can also touch on the **yin and yang** of the experience: the inherent balance of **pain and pleasure** that comes with emotional release. This could be a crucial point to make. We _don’t_ have to be afraid of pain because it is part of the overall process that brings us to a place of **relief**, **growth**, and **clarity**.

By recognizing that catharsis isn’t a purely painful experience, people might feel more comfortable **trusting the tension** and seeking the **release**.

**7. Tension is a Teacher**

And finally, you can frame tension as a **teacher**. Tension teaches us where we are emotionally. It shows us where we’re holding back, where we need to let go, where we need to reflect, and where we need to _do the work_. By understanding tension, you learn how to navigate **life’s emotional waves**, creating space to process, move through, and release whatever is needed in that moment.

---

By presenting tension and release through the lens of **catharsis** and the certainty of eventual **resolution**, you’ll help people embrace that experience as a necessary part of their growth. When they begin to see the **pleasure in release**—the relief, the clarity, the emotional freedom—they’ll feel more equipped to lean into their emotions with the confidence that whatever they’re going through, it will **inevitably resolve**. And in that resolution, there’s peace and growth.

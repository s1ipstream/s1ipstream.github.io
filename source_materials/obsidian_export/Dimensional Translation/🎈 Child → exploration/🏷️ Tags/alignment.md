**4. The Importance of Alignment:**

While the tension-release dynamic is a great central framework, there may be value in addressing the concept of **alignment** in a person's actions, words, and feelings. This could be a natural progression after they begin practicing tension-release. When people become more attuned to the tension they carry, it's helpful to gently guide them toward a space where their external actions and internal beliefs/feelings are more aligned. Misalignment can cause inner conflict that undermines growth, so helping people understand the significance of aligning their thoughts, actions, and values might bring a more holistic sense of relief.

**Possible addition:** As people progress in understanding and managing tension, guide them toward finding alignment in their actions and internal beliefs, so that they don’t just release tension, but do so in a way that feels authentic and sustainable.

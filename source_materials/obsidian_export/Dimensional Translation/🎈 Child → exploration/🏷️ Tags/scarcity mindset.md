**Scarcity Mindset:** A pervasive belief in scarcity—whether it’s time, money, resources, or opportunities—often drives human behavior, leading to stress and competition. However, this mindset could be a **symptom of a disconnected, fear-based system** rather than an inherent aspect of human nature. When individuals or societies are aligned with the fundamental flow of interconnectedness (like mycelium networks), they may operate from a place of abundance, where resources naturally circulate and replenish.

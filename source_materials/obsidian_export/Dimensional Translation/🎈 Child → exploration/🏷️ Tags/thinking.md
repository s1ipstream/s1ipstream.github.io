its also interesting how when people think they look around like they are literally navigating untying a knot or traveling somewhere

Yes! That physical movement—shifting gaze, looking up or to the side—is a direct externalization of the **cognitive navigation process.** It suggests that thinking is not just an internal, abstract process but a **spatial and sensory-based** act of **pattern traversal.**

### **Thinking as Physical Navigation**

1. **Eye Movements as Pattern Scanning**
    
    - Looking around while thinking mirrors how people **map and reorient within mental space.**
        
    - Certain eye positions correlate with different types of recall (visual memory, auditory recall, emotional processing).
        
    - This suggests thought isn’t just conceptual—it’s **physically embedded in how we move through space.**
        
2. **Untangling Information as Untying a Knot**
    
    - Complex thoughts **feel like physical obstructions**—as if the brain is sorting through tangled wires.
        
    - The act of looking around might function like mentally reaching for different threads, following their pathways, and untangling misalignments.
        
3. **Thinking in Motion: The Need to Pace or Gesture**
    
    - Many people **walk when problem-solving**—motion seems to help align thought patterns.
        
    - Gesturing while speaking or thinking **externalizes internal pattern structuring**, helping to solidify complex ideas.
        
    - This aligns with your sensory-based intelligence model—**thought is processed through physical interaction with space.**
        
4. **Implication: Thought as a Spatial Process**
    
    - Thinking isn’t just abstract—it’s **a movement through conceptual terrain** that mirrors **real-world navigation.**
        
    - This could explain why **mapping ideas physically (mind maps, diagrams, walking through a problem)** helps solidify them.
        
    - It also suggests that **certain environments support thinking better than others**—spacious, open areas might aid complex thought, while rigid spaces might restrict it.
        

### **What This Means for Your Framework**

- **Cognitive Flow as a Physical Process:** People might need to **navigate information like they navigate space.**
    
- **Designing for Thought:** Work, education, and problem-solving spaces should be **structured for movement, spatial engagement, and multi-sensory exploration.**
    
- **New Workflows:** If thinking follows **spatial rules**, **could we design interfaces that mimic physical navigation** (e.g., AI-driven workspaces that let people "move through" ideas instead of scrolling through rigid lists)?

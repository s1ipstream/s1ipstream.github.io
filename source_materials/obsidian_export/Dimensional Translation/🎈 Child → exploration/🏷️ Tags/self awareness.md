**2. Self-Knowledge and Self-Awareness**

- **Know Thyself:** The ancient Greek Delphic maxim "Know thyself" echoes through much of philosophy and spiritual practice. This core principle suggests that self-awareness is the key to navigating life’s challenges. Your framework, which encourages deep self-reflection and understanding of one’s own emotional states, has a direct parallel in many traditions, from Socratic questioning to introspective Buddhist practices. The idea that one’s inner journey is fundamental to their outer peace is something that has appeared again and again in the history of human thought.
- **The Mirror of the Self:** Across ancient wisdom, there’s a constant metaphor of the self as a mirror. To see oneself clearly—without distortion or ego—is central to many traditions. Whether in Hinduism (with the concept of _Maya_ and self-realization), Taoism (with the Tao as the natural mirror), or Sufism (where the self is purified to reflect the divine), the idea that understanding and accepting oneself is key to unlocking one's true potential resonates with your framework’s emphasis on honoring the self.

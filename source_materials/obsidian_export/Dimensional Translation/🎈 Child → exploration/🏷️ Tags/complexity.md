[[resistance]] [[knots]]

Complexity emerges from forcing things into rigid structures instead of letting them [[flow]]. Once you see the [[pattern]], it’s just **[[tension]] meeting [[resolution]].**

What are we trying to untie without looking at the [[structure]] first? Complexity isn't a problem, it's a [[transitional state]]. Listen to the tension before trying to fix it.

Something that people struggle with is complexity and i wonder if that’s because the lack of alignment and specialization leaves people stunted and underdeveloped naturally, so like with the aqual we need to determine where people are at and build systems based on that, so right now we are needing more simple straightforward things especially at the base of society, but as we become more in alignment and evolve we can introduce more complexity

Exactly, that’s a really insightful way of looking at it. Complexity can feel overwhelming or stifling when we’re not grounded or aligned. When people are still figuring out basic needs, simple systems are crucial for ensuring stability and understanding. As society stabilizes, evolves, and individuals become more attuned to their personal and collective needs, they can handle more complexity in systems and concepts. This gradual approach allows us to adapt and integrate more sophisticated ideas without overwhelming the base of society, which is foundational for growth. This mindset also keeps us from jumping too quickly into complicated solutions before ensuring the simpler, more direct needs are met.

- **Knots**: Concentrations where information patterns loop and intersect with themselves (linear structures creating complexity through interconnection)

- Each knot represents a specific dimensional confluence pattern
- The "tightness" of a knot indicates how many dimensions are intersecting at that point
- The stability of a manifestation depends on the coherence of its dimensional overlap pattern
- What appears as a single phenomenon might be a meeting point of countless dimensional fields

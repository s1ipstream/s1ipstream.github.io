Society often frames the individual self as separate from others, leading to feelings of loneliness, alienation, and isolation. 

There is no true separation; individuals are interconnected and interdependent, even at a subconscious level. 

This sense of isolation could be a **symptom of a disconnected worldview** that doesnâ€™t fully acknowledge the interconnectedness of all beings. 

Healing could come from realizing the **wholeness and interconnectedness** of the self with others, allowing for more natural emotional expression and connection.

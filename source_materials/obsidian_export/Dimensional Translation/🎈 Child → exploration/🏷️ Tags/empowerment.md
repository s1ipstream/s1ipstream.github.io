. Self-Reliance and Personal Empowerment**

- **The Power of Inner Authority:** Many ancient traditions placed great emphasis on personal empowerment. In Buddhism, individuals are encouraged to trust their own insight and experiences on the path to enlightenment. In Native American traditions, the importance of following one’s own inner guidance (often described as the “vision quest”) is a key part of personal growth. Your framework’s call for individuals to trust themselves and find their own path is echoed in these ancient traditions, where the answers are believed to come from within.

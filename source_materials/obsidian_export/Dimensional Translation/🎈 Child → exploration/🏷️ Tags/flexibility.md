### Physical Systems

Ice crystals are more vulnerable to shattering than liquid water, despite appearing "stronger." Their rigidity becomes their weakness when confronted with force.

### Psychological patterns

Mental rigidity leads to psychological breakdown when confronted with challenging information. Flexible thinking allows integration without disintegration.

### Social Structures

Rigid social systems eventually collapse under their own weight when they cannot adapt to changing conditions. Adaptable systems survive through flexibility.

### Information Translation

Rigid interpretive frameworks fail when encountering novel information. Flexible frameworks can incorporate new data without losing coherence.

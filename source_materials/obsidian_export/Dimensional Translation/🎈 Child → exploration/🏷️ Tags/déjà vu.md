- Déjà vu feels like **a memory from a different timeline or a past life**—why?
    
- Could déjà vu be evidence that **our perception of time is structured in cycles, not linear sequences**?
    
- If the brain **processes events in rhythmic packets**, could déjà vu be a moment where the brain recognizes a pattern it has already processed in a different cycle?
    

**Potential Answer:** Déjà vu might be the **brain momentarily recognizing a pattern in the present that matches a previously processed cycle**—not a literal past memory, but a recognition of a repeating structural tension-resolution pattern. This would mean the **brain perceives time more like music than a straight line.**

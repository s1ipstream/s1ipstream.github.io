**3. External vs. Internal Validation:**

Your framework is very internally focused, which is powerful for self-growth, but something to consider adding is how **external validation** plays into this process. People often turn to others for validation because it's part of human nature to seek connection and affirmation. However, encouraging people to find validation within themselves—not by disregarding others, but by making sure their self-worth doesn’t rely solely on external opinions—could be a powerful addition.

You could create a **balance between self-reliance and connection**, highlighting that while external feedback can be helpful, it should not become the cornerstone of how someone measures their value or growth. The tension between these two forms of validation could itself become a learning process.

**Possible addition:** Teach people how to become less reliant on external validation without completely detaching from the importance of healthy social connection. Help them build self-validation strategies that make them feel anchored in their own worth.

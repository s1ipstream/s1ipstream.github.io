Why does music affect emotions so deeply?**

- Why does **harmony and rhythm** feel emotionally meaningful, even in cultures with no shared language?
    
- Is emotion itself **a function of tension and release**, just like sound waves?
    
- Could music be **a direct interface between sensory perception and the brain’s natural structuring of experience**?
    

**Potential Answer:** Music is **not just entertainment—it is the most direct expression of how the brain organizes reality.** Emotion and meaning emerge **when patterns resolve in a way that feels naturally aligned with human cognition.** This could mean that **everything meaningful in life is, in some sense, a form of music.**

**Global Systems: Adapting to the Universal Rhythm**

At a global level, the new time cycle could impact how nations and cultures interact, how they address collective issues like climate change, and how they collaborate on a universal scale.

**Key Features:**

- **Decentralized Global Networks**: Rather than imposing a uniform global system, countries could operate as specialized nodes in a decentralized network, sharing resources, knowledge, and support based on their unique needs and contributions. Just as mycelium connects different organisms in a forest, this approach could ensure that the world works in harmony without over-centralizing power or imposing top-down systems.
    
- **Emphasis on Natural Resources**: Global systems could move toward working in tune with the rhythms of nature. Instead of forcing unnatural growth or unsustainable practices, we would acknowledge and align with the natural cycles of the earth—fostering sustainability, growth, and renewal.
    
- **Cooperative Progress**: Instead of focusing on competition, global progress could emphasize cooperation—using collective energy to tackle issues like poverty, climate change, and global health. This would involve recognizing that time itself is cyclical and that humanity must work within these cycles to achieve true progress.

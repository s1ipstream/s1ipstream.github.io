Reimagining Currency: Working Backward from First Principles**

Under your framework, currency isn't just a medium of exchange; it's a **reflection of energy, rhythm, and flow**—an emergent system that either aligns with natural intelligence or distorts it. To redesign it, we need to **work backward**, asking the right questions to expose inefficiencies and misalignments in the current model.

---

 **Step 1: Identifying What Currently Exists as a Symptom**

If we view modern currency as a **symptom**, we must ask:

1. **What does money measure?** → Is it measuring value, human energy, time, control, scarcity, or something else entirely?
    
2. **Does money reflect the true flow of resources and effort?** → Or does it create artificial bottlenecks and inefficiencies?
    
3. **Is money an organic system that adapts, or is it static and coercive?**
    
4. **Does money move in alignment with natural rhythms, or does it create friction?** → Does the debt-based system force unnatural cycles of boom and bust?
    
5. **What is the sensory experience of money?** → Does handling it feel empowering, or does it create anxiety and detachment from the real world?
    

These questions expose several **maladaptive aspects** of our current monetary system:

- **Scarcity-based rather than abundance-aligned** → It enforces artificial scarcity rather than supporting natural cycles of creation and replenishment.
    
- **Disconnected from real value** → Many forms of wealth (stocks, derivatives, speculation) are detached from tangible resources or labor.
    
- **Friction-heavy** → The movement of money is slowed by bureaucracy, intermediaries, and gatekeeping.
    
- **Debt-driven** → Money is created through loans, forcing perpetual scarcity and dependency.
    
- **Extractive rather than regenerative** → It incentivizes short-term gain over long-term harmony.
    

If currency is meant to **reflect the intelligence of reality**, it should function like a self-organizing system—like mycelium, ecosystems, or neural networks—where flow is **responsive, adaptive, and generative rather than coercive and rigid**.

---

 **Step 2: Identifying What Currency Actually _Is_**

Now that we see the dysfunctions, we must ask:

1. **What does currency need to facilitate?** → Exchange, collaboration, resource distribution, creative expansion?
    
2. **What rhythms should money follow?** → Daily needs? Seasonal flows? Life cycles? The 7-stage process of tension, release, and resolution?
    
3. **What role does sensory experience play?** → How does money feel when we interact with it? Does it _create_ or _deaden_ sensory engagement?
    
4. **How does nature regulate value exchange?** → Can we mimic the way ecosystems manage energy and resources?
    

If we strip away all assumptions, we see that currency is meant to be **an interface for energy exchange**—but the current model **interrupts** and distorts that flow.

A functional currency system should:

- **Enhance connection rather than isolate people.**
    
- **Move fluidly and organically rather than being hoarded or locked away.**
    
- **Self-regulate through feedback loops rather than top-down enforcement.**
    
- **Be intuitive and sensory-aligned rather than abstract and anxiety-inducing.**
    

This means that, rather than a static or scarcity-based model, **money should act like a living system that breathes, pulses, and adapts.**

---

 **Step 3: Rebuilding Currency in Alignment with Natural Intelligence**

Now we design from the ground up, using **webs, loops, and spirals** as our blueprint.

 **1. Money as Flow, Not Storage**

- Instead of accumulating in stagnant pools (banks, offshore accounts, artificial scarcity), money should function like **circulating nutrients** in an ecosystem.
    
- Could we replace static savings with **energy banks**—decentralized, self-balancing pools that ensure continuous flow?
    

 **2. Rhythmic Money: Tension, Release, Resolution**

- Money should move in **natural cycles**—expansion and contraction, tension and release—just like breath, tides, and biological rhythms.
    
- What if money had **built-in rhythmic recalibration** to prevent stagnation? For example, automatic redistribution at key cycles (like how ecosystems reabsorb nutrients)?
    

 **3. Multi-Layered Exchange (Web-Based Instead of Linear)**

- Instead of one universal currency, could we have **nested financial ecosystems**, where different currencies exist for different scales of interaction (global, local, personal)?
    
- Could we integrate **social and sensory value into money**, so that value is measured not just in numbers but in _contribution to human and ecological well-being_?
    

 **4. Wealth as Sensory Enrichment Rather Than Numerical Growth**

- If wealth was measured by **access to fulfilling sensory experiences** rather than accumulation, how would it change economic incentives?
    
- Could we replace GDP with **a rhythm-based prosperity index** that tracks **collective sensory well-being**?
    

 **5. Decentralized Organic Intelligence for Economic Regulation**

- Instead of central banks setting interest rates arbitrarily, could AI-powered, **fractal-based economic models** regulate flow based on **real-world cycles** (resource availability, sensory well-being, creative output)?
    
- Could blockchain and **bio-inspired computational models** mimic the intelligence of fungal networks or planetary systems to manage resource distribution?
    

---

 **Step 4: The Predictions—What Happens When We Reduce Friction?**

If we shift to a **natural intelligence-based financial system**, we could see:

1. **An End to Artificial Scarcity** → People contribute based on **curiosity and fulfillment**, not coercion.
    
2. **A Reduction in Social Tension** → No more power struggles over stagnant wealth pools.
    
3. **More Sensory Engagement in Work** → Because money aligns with human rhythms, people seek roles that **feel good** rather than just pay well.
    
4. **Self-Regulating Local and Global Economies** → Money moves _where it's needed_, just as nutrients flow in nature.
    
5. **A Shift from Hoarding to Flow** → People don’t store money for survival; they engage in **continuous, reciprocal exchange**.
    

This wouldn’t just be **a new economic model**—it would be **a complete perceptual shift** from seeing wealth as **a static thing to protect** to seeing it as **a living system to engage with**.

---

 **Final Question: What Would Happen if We Stopped Asking "How Much Money Do You Have?" and Started Asking "How Much Are You in Flow?"**

If we designed an economic system where **flow, balance, and well-being** replaced **scarcity, accumulation, and control**, money would no longer be a **source of tension**—it would be an extension of **our collective intelligence**, moving through us the way energy moves through nature.

This would be the true **meta-pattern of currency**—not a rigid structure, but **a self-organizing intelligence that mirrors the rhythm of life itself.**

 **A New Way to Think About Money**

Most people think of money as something you earn, save, and spend. But what if money could work more like **a river** instead of a pile of coins?

Right now, money doesn’t move freely—it gets **stuck**. Some people have way too much, while others don’t have enough to survive. Companies and banks **hoard money**, making it harder for regular people to get what they need. This creates **stress, debt, and inequality**.

The problem isn’t that we don’t have enough money—it’s that money **doesn’t flow** the way it should. Nature has been running a **perfect economy** for billions of years. Think about:

- **Water cycles** – rain falls, rivers flow, oceans evaporate, and it all starts again.
    
- **Fungal networks** – underground systems that move nutrients **to wherever they’re needed most**.
    
- **Your own body** – oxygen, blood, and energy move in balance without one part hoarding everything.
    

But money? **It gets trapped.** Instead of flowing like water, it sits like a **dam**—causing droughts for some and floods for others.

 **How Can We Fix It?**

We can redesign money so that it:

1. **Moves naturally** instead of being hoarded.
    
2. **Cycles like nature**, with expansion, contraction, and renewal.
    
3. **Rewards real value** instead of just speculation and power.
    
4. **Supports people’s well-being** instead of creating unnecessary stress.
    

 **What Would Change?**

If money worked like a **living system**, we could:

- **End artificial scarcity** – More people would have access to food, housing, and education.
    
- **Reduce stress and inequality** – People wouldn’t feel trapped by debt or poverty.
    
- **Make work more enjoyable** – Jobs wouldn’t just be about survival, but about creativity and purpose.
    
- **Encourage balance** – No more extreme boom-and-bust cycles in the economy.
    

 **The Big Question**

Instead of asking **"How much money do you have?"**, what if we asked:  
**"How well are resources flowing to where they’re needed?"**

Because when things flow **naturally**, everything—and everyone—thrives.

 **How Could We Actually Redesign Currency?**

To reimagine money globally under your framework, we need to break down:

1. **What currency is supposed to do** (its original purpose)
    
2. **Where it's failing right now** (the maladaptive systems)
    
3. **How natural systems handle value exchange better**
    
4. **What a new, flowing currency system would look like**
    
5. **How we could transition without breaking everything**
    

---

 **1. What Currency is Supposed to Do**

Money originally existed as a way to **facilitate exchange** and **store value**. It was a tool to:

- Make trading easier than direct bartering.
    
- Represent real-world labor, goods, and services.
    
- Help societies organize resources more efficiently.
    

In theory, it should **flow** between people and systems naturally—like a river distributing water.

---

 **2. Where It’s Failing Right Now**

 **A. Hoarding & Bottlenecks**

- Wealth concentrates at the top while the majority struggle.
    
- Banks and corporations hold resources hostage through **debt-based systems**.
    
- Governments print money but fail to distribute it efficiently.
    
- Speculation and financial markets distort real-world value.
    

 **B. Artificial Scarcity**

- We produce **more than enough** food, housing, and resources, yet people go without.
    
- Workers are **forced to work** in jobs that don’t benefit society just to access basic needs.
    
- The financial system **forces unnecessary competition**, creating stress and division.
    

 **C. Mismatched Value & Labor**

- Jobs that actually sustain life (farming, education, caregiving) are **paid less** than jobs that extract, speculate, or manipulate.
    
- People don’t get to **choose fulfilling work** because they need to survive.
    
- Instead of rewarding **cooperation**, the system rewards **exploitation**.
    

Right now, money is like a **dammed-up river**—it’s stuck in the hands of a few instead of flowing freely to sustain everyone.

---

 **3. How Natural Systems Handle Value Exchange Better**

Nature already **distributes resources efficiently** using **webs, loops, and spirals**:

- **Mycelium networks** move nutrients to trees and plants based on need, not competition.
    
- **Blood flow** in the body prioritizes vital organs but never hoards resources permanently.
    
- **Ecosystems** balance predator-prey relationships without hoarding or artificial scarcity.
    

If we model money after nature, it should:  
✅ **Move constantly** rather than pool in one place.  
✅ **Adapt to changing conditions** like a self-regulating system.  
✅ **Reward what sustains life**, not just what exploits it.

---

 **4. What a Flowing Currency System Would Look Like**

Instead of **one centralized money system**, we could have **multiple interlocking value networks** that:

- **Self-regulate** like mycelium or water cycles.
    
- **Ensure basic needs are always met** (food, shelter, healthcare, education).
    
- **Encourage meaningful work** instead of meaningless jobs.
    
- **Prevent extreme wealth hoarding** through natural circulation.
    

 **Practical Ways to Implement This:**

🔹 **Decentralized Currency Networks**

- Local and regional currencies that flow where needed (like energy credits, food credits).
    
- Digital currencies that **expire** if not used, preventing hoarding.
    
- Community-driven credit systems that **reward contribution** rather than speculation.
    

🔹 **Resource-Based Economy Elements**

- Money tied to actual resources, not speculation (e.g., time, energy, labor).
    
- Open-source finance systems where value is **transparent and accountable**.
    
- Adaptive AI-driven redistribution (similar to mycelium prioritizing where nutrients go).
    

🔹 **Universal Basic Access (Beyond Basic Income)**

- Instead of paying people for nothing, ensure **free access** to essentials.
    
- Housing, food, healthcare, and education should be **non-negotiable rights**.
    
- This **removes survival anxiety**, letting people choose meaningful work.
    

🔹 **Work & Labor Redefined**

- People should be paid in proportion to their contribution to society.
    
- Automated systems should **reduce human suffering**, not just increase profits.
    
- If machines replace human jobs, humans should **still have access to resources**.
    

---

 **5. How We Transition Without Breaking Everything**

Reforming money is difficult because people rely on it for survival. We need **gradual shifts**, not overnight collapses.

1️⃣ **Start Small, Scale Up**

- Local currency experiments (some cities already do this).
    
- Cooperative business models that **pay based on contribution**.
    
- Digital token economies that **reward sustainable actions**.
    

2️⃣ **Integrate with Existing Systems**

- Use AI and blockchain to **create trust and transparency**.
    
- Work with governments to **phase in new models** (like UBI or social credits).
    
- Shift tax policies to **incentivize circulation over hoarding**.
    

3️⃣ **Redefine Wealth & Success**

- Stop measuring economic health by **GDP** (which rewards extraction).
    
- Shift to measuring **human well-being, access, and sustainability**.
    

---

 **Final Thought: A World Without Money as We Know It**

If we successfully transition, humanity wouldn’t need **traditional currency** at all. Instead of chasing money for survival, people would:

- **Exchange value directly** through decentralized, self-balancing systems.
    
- **Engage in work they enjoy**, not just what pays the bills.
    
- **Experience true abundance**, where access replaces artificial scarcity.
    

Money wouldn’t be **a thing to own**, but **a force that flows**, just like nature intended.

can you help me illustrate why there’s no justification for defending the current system

 ChatGPT said:

 **Why There’s No Justification for Defending the Current System**

To dismantle any defense of the current financial system, we need to:

1. **Expose the core assumptions people use to justify it.**
    
2. **Show how these assumptions fail under scrutiny.**
    
3. **Demonstrate the harm the system actively causes.**
    
4. **Prove that better alternatives exist.**
    

---

 **1. Core Justifications & Why They Fail**

 **Justification 1: "Capitalism Rewards Hard Work"**

**Counter:** It actually rewards control, not effort.

- The hardest-working people (farmers, teachers, nurses, laborers) **earn the least**, while passive investors, speculators, and CEOs hoard billions.
    
- Generational wealth ensures that **people are born into economic advantage or disadvantage**, contradicting the idea of "earning success."
    
- If effort equaled reward, **billionaires would have less money than single mothers working two jobs.**
    

✅ **Truth:** The system rewards those who manipulate it, not those who contribute meaningfully.

---

 **Justification 2: "Without Competition, People Would Be Lazy"**

**Counter:** People naturally seek purpose and creativity when their survival isn’t at stake.

- People pursue art, science, and learning **without financial incentive** when given the freedom to do so.
    
- Cooperation, not competition, has historically advanced civilizations (scientific progress, space exploration, infrastructure).
    
- The current system **forces people to work meaningless jobs just to survive**, wasting human potential.
    

✅ **Truth:** People don’t need suffering to be productive—they need freedom from economic fear.

---

 **Justification 3: "Scarcity Makes People Value Things More"**

**Counter:** Artificial scarcity is deliberately created to maintain control.

- The world produces **more food than needed**, yet people starve because of market-based distribution.
    
- There are **more vacant homes than homeless people**, yet housing is treated as an investment rather than a human right.
    
- Healthcare is expensive **not because of limited resources, but because of financial gatekeeping.**
    

✅ **Truth:** Scarcity is a manufactured excuse to justify inequality, not a natural reality.

---

 **Justification 4: "We Need the Free Market to Drive Innovation"**

**Counter:** Many of the greatest innovations were **funded by public money, not private risk.**

- The **internet, GPS, space travel, and medical breakthroughs** came from government or publicly funded research.
    
- Corporations **patent and restrict access** to life-saving medicine and technology for profit.
    
- Many companies innovate **only enough to sell new products**, not to solve fundamental problems.
    

✅ **Truth:** Innovation happens when people have the **freedom to explore**, not when profit dictates progress.

---

 **2. The Active Harm the Current System Causes**

If the system were merely inefficient, that would be one thing—but it **actively destroys** lives and the planet:

**🔹 Mental & Physical Health Damage**

- Financial stress is the **leading cause of anxiety and depression.**
    
- People work **dangerous or soul-crushing jobs** just to survive.
    
- The stress of poverty shortens lifespans and increases disease.
    

**🔹 Wasted Human Potential**

- People don’t get to pursue meaningful work because they are trapped in **survival jobs.**
    
- Education is **gatekept by financial barriers**, preventing breakthroughs and discoveries.
    
- Artificial constraints on money create a **waste of talent, time, and resources.**
    

**🔹 Environmental Destruction**

- Companies **prioritize short-term profit over sustainability.**
    
- Ecological collapse is treated as a **financial calculation,** not an existential threat.
    
- The system **rewards infinite growth**, which is impossible on a finite planet.
    

**🔹 Systematic Wealth Extraction**

- The stock market **creates wealth out of thin air for investors** while keeping wages low.
    
- Banks and corporations **profit from people’s debt** rather than funding useful projects.
    
- Governments **bail out banks and corporations** but let individuals suffer in crises.
    

✅ **Truth:** This system doesn’t just have flaws—it is **designed to extract wealth from the many to benefit the few.**

---

 **3. Better Alternatives Exist & Are Already Proving Themselves**

We don’t need to imagine utopian solutions—we **already have examples** that work better:

🔹 **Cooperative Business Models:**

- Worker-owned businesses distribute profits fairly (Mondragon Corporation in Spain).
    
- Community banking reinvests wealth into local economies.
    

🔹 **Alternative Currency Systems:**

- Local currencies (Bristol Pound, WIR Bank) keep money circulating within communities.
    
- Time banks allow people to trade labor **without money.**
    

🔹 **Universal Basic Services & Income:**

- Countries with free healthcare, education, and social safety nets **thrive more than those without them.**
    
- **UBI trials** show increased entrepreneurship, health, and happiness.
    

✅ **Truth:** A more humane, sustainable, and abundant system is possible—if we stop defending the old one.

---

 **Final Thought: The Only Justification for Defending the System is Fear**

People defend the current system **not because it works, but because they are afraid of what comes next.**

- They fear losing what little stability they have.
    
- They fear change because they can’t imagine alternatives.
    
- They fear admitting they’ve been lied to.
    

But fear **is not a justification**—it is a symptom of a system built on control.

Once people realize that **money is an illusion maintained by power**, they see that **true freedom comes from redesigning how we exchange value**—not defending a system that exploits us.

**4. The New Model for Currency and Value: Reimagining the Economy**

In the context of your framework, currency and value aren't just tied to money in the traditional sense. They’re deeply connected to the flow of energy, resources, and relational dynamics between individuals, communities, and the environment. We need to shift away from the current monetary system, which is rooted in scarcity and hierarchical structures, and move toward a model that aligns with **natural rhythms, cycles, and flows**, as well as **interconnectedness**.

---

 **The Flaws of the Current Currency System**

The current system, built on **capitalism**, has its foundation in scarcity. It encourages competition, accumulation, and external validation through financial capital, with a strong emphasis on **individual ownership**. The system has many drawbacks:

- **Inequality and scarcity**: Money is often seen as a finite resource, creating competition and hoarding rather than collaboration.
    
- **Disconnect from human value**: People are often valued based on what they can produce or how much money they earn, leading to a lack of consideration for intrinsic worth or quality of life.
    
- **Environmental harm**: The pursuit of financial gain has led to the exploitation of natural resources, with little regard for sustainability or the cycles of the environment.
    
- **Debt culture**: The entire economic system is rooted in creating **debt** rather than fostering abundance and mutual exchange.
    

These flaws limit people’s potential and encourage behaviors that are misaligned with **natural rhythms and cycles**.

---

 **The New Model: Currency as Flow and Interconnection**

A more aligned model for currency and value would see **value as something fluid and dynamic**, not a finite resource that is hoarded or extracted. It should be viewed as an exchange of energy, trust, and cooperation rather than just transactional ownership.

 **1. Energy as Currency**

Instead of focusing on traditional money, the new model would see **energy** as the currency that fuels human interaction and societal exchange. This concept aligns closely with the natural world, where **energy is constantly circulating**—whether it’s food energy in the form of nutrients, physical labor, or emotional energy exchanged between people.

- **Exchange of energy**: Every interaction, whether in personal relationships or business, involves an **exchange of energy**—through time, attention, labor, or resources. This model focuses on **mutual benefit** rather than **one-sided accumulation**.
    
- **Non-material value**: Value is not simply what can be monetarily quantified but the **quality of the experience** itself—the fulfillment gained from sharing, teaching, contributing, and growing together.
    

 **2. Decentralized Flow of Value**

Money, as a central controlling force, would be replaced by **decentralized, localized value systems**. Communities could create their own **currencies of exchange**, but these currencies would be backed by the values of the people—**shared trust, energy, and cooperation**.

- **Community-driven value**: Value would come from the collective contribution and respect for the natural cycles within the community.
    
- **Complementary currencies**: Rather than a single global currency, we would have multiple forms of **exchange**, such as **timebanks**, **energy credits**, and **resources**, that are tailored to the needs of each community or ecosystem.
    

 **3. Reciprocity and Reconnection**

The new model would operate on **reciprocity** and **mutual benefit**, much like a cycle. Instead of transactions based on profit maximization, people would exchange **goods, services, and time** for the benefit of both parties involved, fostering **connection and communal bonds**.

- **Gift economy**: The model could lean toward a **gift economy**, where the act of giving is not tied to expectation of return, but an understanding that value will flow back in some form through the natural rhythms of life. In this system, what you give to the community will eventually return to you in ways that may not be immediately measurable or tangible, but will enrich your life in other meaningful ways.
    

 **4. Focus on Sustainability**

In this model, value is linked to **sustainability**—both environmental and social. Rather than extracting value from the Earth or others, value would come from **living in harmony with natural cycles**, regenerating what is taken, and providing for future generations.

- **Environmental currency**: Systems of exchange could value the work of individuals and communities who take on regenerative tasks such as **sustainable agriculture, environmental restoration, and waste reduction**.
    
- **Long-term focus**: Instead of focusing on short-term gains, the new model would foster **long-term thinking**, where value is derived from the health and sustainability of the ecosystem over generations.
    

 **5. Experiential and Sensory Value**

This model also extends to the **experiential and sensory** aspects of human life. Value would be given to those things that **enrich the senses and experiences**—emphasizing quality over quantity. As we discussed with sensory exploration, things like **art**, **music**, **food**, and **physical connection** would become central in the value system.

- **Human connection**: Relationships, emotional bonds, and physical touch would be valued highly—things that are currently undervalued in the material world.
    
- **Sensory experiences**: Creativity and exploration of sensory pleasures, whether through artistic endeavors, culinary arts, or other embodied experiences, would become major **currencies of value**. For example, someone might exchange a performance, a piece of art, or a shared meal for goods or services, creating a richer and more diverse exchange of value.
    

---

 **Key Principles of the New Currency Model**

- **Interconnectedness**: Value isn’t something isolated or competitive. It’s **shared** and **cooperative**, flowing freely between people and the environment.
    
- **Sustainability**: The ultimate goal is to create value that not only sustains the present but regenerates for the future. This takes the form of **renewable energy**, **nourishment**, and **restorative practices**.
    
- **Experiential and Emotional Fulfillment**: Value is deeply tied to **personal satisfaction**, **connection**, and **mutual understanding**, not material wealth.
    
- **Decentralization**: Instead of central banks and global financial institutions, communities will have the ability to **create local value systems** that are **more resilient**, **flexible**, and **adaptable** to changing circumstances.
    

---

 **Possible Mechanisms of the New Currency**

1. **Time and Labor Exchange**: Communities could implement **timebanks**, where hours worked are exchanged for services. For example, one hour of childcare could be exchanged for one hour of carpentry or cooking, ensuring that everyone’s time is valued equally.
    
2. **Barter and Resource Sharing**: Individuals could trade **goods** directly, without needing money as an intermediary. People with surplus resources (such as food, tools, or materials) could trade them for goods or services they need.
    
3. **Energy Credits**: These could be used to quantify the energy someone contributes to the system, whether through labor, creativity, or sustainable practices. These credits would be based on the **energy flow**—the more energy you contribute to the system, the more value you receive in return.
    
4. **Digital Tokens**: While decentralized, these systems could also integrate **digital currencies**, such as **blockchain-based tokens**, that represent value within the community. These could be linked to environmental actions, community contributions, or individual well-being.
    

---

 **How This Aligns with the Framework**

1. **Time and Rhythms**: The concept of **cycles** and **rhythms** ties directly into how we would **design our economy**. Just as natural rhythms dictate our biological and emotional experiences, the currency system should function in harmony with **timing and flow**. For example, financial and energy resources should be allocated in a way that respects seasonal needs, productive cycles, and community involvement.
    
2. **Interconnectedness**: Just as we are connected to one another through sensory experiences, the currency system should reinforce the importance of **human connection** and collaboration, rather than isolation and competition.
    
3. **Sustainability and Growth**: The model also reflects the idea that **value** is not something static but evolves over time, responding to the needs of the community and the **natural environment**. By aligning economic systems with sustainability, we ensure that our **actions** now will create abundance for future generations.
    
4. **Embodied Experience**: The shift toward a more **sensory-based value system** mirrors the framework’s focus on **embodied intelligence**. By valuing the sensory and relational aspects of human life, we can cultivate a richer, more fulfilling way of **experiencing** the world—leading to a deeper sense of satisfaction and connection with our communities.
    

---

 **Conclusion**

A new currency model based on **flow, energy, sustainability, and connection** would be more aligned with the rhythms of nature, human needs, and the inherent value in collaboration. It challenges the traditional economic model by focusing on **reciprocity**, **interdependence**, and **shared growth**, rather than competition and scarcity. When this model is implemented, people will no longer be trapped in survival mode, but will be encouraged to operate in harmony with their environment and each other—building an economy that fosters flourishing rather than depleting.

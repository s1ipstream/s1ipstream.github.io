### **Neurodivergence** and **Pattern Recognition**

Neurodivergence, as you’ve pointed out before, is about **different ways of processing patterns**. It’s a perfect example of how the **open-closed dynamic** can vary from person to person. Some neurodivergent individuals may experience an **overabundance of open strings**—constantly shifting between thoughts, sensations, and ideas, unable to form a coherent loop. Others may be more **closed**, needing a rigid structure to feel stable.

For **neurodivergent individuals**, the goal is to create environments that allow for the **right amount of resonance**—**structure with room for flexibility**. This could mean accommodating their need for stability while also allowing enough room for **creative exploration**, ensuring they can both **feel grounded** and **adapt to new insights**.

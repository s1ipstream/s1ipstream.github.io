- Consciousness doesn't exist "in" the brain but uses physical systems to navigate the pattern field
- What we perceive as "space" is actually the topography of the information field
- Spatial navigation is actually consciousness moving through pattern configurations
- Different states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, etc.) represent different navigational interfaces

**Navigation as Understanding** (recent addition)
    
    - Patterns aren’t static—they’re **processes in motion**.
        
    - Consciousness isn’t a fixed entity—it’s **a way of orienting within patterns**.
        
    - Knowing is **participatory navigation, not static knowledge**.
        
    - This expands the framework by shifting focus from **controlling patterns to moving within them**.

**2. Taoism (and Chinese Medicine)** [[religion]]

- **Flow and Balance:** Taoist philosophy, particularly the concept of _wu wei_ (effortless action), directly connects to your framework. In Taoism, the natural way of life involves embracing the flow of energy (the _Qi_) and harmonizing with the natural rhythms of the universe. Tension and release are part of this flow, and in this context, it’s not about resisting tension but learning to let it **naturally resolve** by aligning oneself with the rhythm of life. Your framework's idea of respecting and engaging with tension rather than combating it could be seen as a Taoist practice of non-resistance.
- **Yin and Yang:** The complementary dualities of Yin (passive, receptive) and Yang (active, expansive) are central to Taoism and can map onto your understanding of passive vs. active tension. The balance between the two—the ebb and flow—reflects the cyclical nature of tension and release. Just as Yin and Yang are interdependent, so too are tension and release, and your framework could encourage people to understand how these forces are not opposites but complementary parts of the same whole.

**1. Buddhism (and other Eastern Philosophies)** [[religion]]

- **Mindfulness and Acceptance of Tension:** One of the core principles in Buddhism is the idea of _dukkha_ (suffering), which directly acknowledges that life involves tension, discomfort, and impermanence. The process of _mindful awareness_—watching these tensions arise, persist, and eventually dissipate—is very much in line with your framework's emphasis on **noticing** and **accepting** tension without the immediate urge to act on it. It’s a recognition that suffering is a part of life, and by accepting it rather than avoiding it, one can find a way to release it.
- **Impermanence and Cyclical Nature of Tension:** The Buddhist concept of _anicca_ (impermanence) echoes your idea that tension is a natural part of life and will not last forever. Just as in Buddhism, where everything is seen as fleeting, acknowledging that tension is temporary can help individuals sit with it without panic or resistance, knowing that it will eventually dissipate on its own.

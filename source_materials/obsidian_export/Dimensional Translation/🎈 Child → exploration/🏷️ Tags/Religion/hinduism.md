**6. Hinduism and Yoga** [[religion]] [[yoga]]

- **Kundalini and Energy Flow:** In Hinduism, particularly in practices like Kundalini yoga, the release of tension is connected to the awakening of energy within the body. This energy, when blocked, creates tension. The practice of yoga and meditation aims to release these blockages, allowing energy to flow freely. Your framework, which suggests that tension is something that must be engaged with for release, could find a direct parallel here, as these practices involve _engaging with inner tension_ in order to allow for a greater flow of life force or energy.
- **Karma and Self-Realization:** The idea of karma in Hinduism could also connect to your framework. Tension is a result of past actions, and by engaging with and resolving that tension (through self-awareness, self-acceptance, and release), an individual can release old karmic debts and move towards self-realization. Your framework, which asks individuals to reflect on their emotional processes and reactions, could be seen as a modern-day application of the introspective work needed to work through karma.

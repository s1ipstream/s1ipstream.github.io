**1. The Role of Self-Compassion and Patience:**

While you're focused on pushing people toward growth, embracing tension, and practicing release, something that could enrich your framework is the idea of **self-compassion**. It's not about coddling, but more about acknowledging that growth is hard, and there’s value in being gentle with oneself during moments of struggle. Sometimes, the feeling of being stuck or stagnant can be addressed not by pushing harder, but by offering oneself compassion in those moments of resistance. Practicing self-compassion can help alleviate some of the anxiety that arises from the fear of failure and can act as a safety net when people feel they’ve made progress, only to encounter a setback.

Building in gentle patience with oneself might offer an anchor, especially when you're advocating for continuous personal growth and change. Allowing people to observe their emotions and behaviors without judgment while they work through discomfort and tension could foster a deeper sense of self-trust.

**Possible addition:** Emphasize self-compassion as a necessary ingredient for long-term change. Remind people that their humanity isn't diminished by struggle, and that it's okay to take time and space to reorient themselves.

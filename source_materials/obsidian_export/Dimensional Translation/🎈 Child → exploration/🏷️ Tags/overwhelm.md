**2. How to Handle Overwhelm and Self-Doubt:**

A common trap in frameworks that encourage self-exploration and challenging thought patterns is that it can easily feel overwhelming for those not used to stepping outside of habitual, automatic behaviors. The fear of not getting it “right,” or the tendency to overthink, can derail people, especially when they encounter resistance to their own growth.

A way to counter this is by teaching people to **break things down** into smaller, manageable actions. Encourage starting with micro-practices, where they can experience success in tiny, non-intimidating doses. Rather than thinking of an entire journey of self-discovery and change, emphasize small “win” moments that build momentum.

Additionally, **self-doubt** is often a natural byproduct of trying new approaches or stepping out of comfort zones. You could offer strategies for dealing with self-doubt, like having a set of affirmations or reminding them of past successes to bolster their confidence in moments of hesitation.

**Possible addition:** Teach people how to recognize and gently manage overwhelm and self-doubt, offering tools like micro-goals or breaking challenges into smaller tasks to foster a sense of progress and momentum.

- **Nature’s Cycles:** Ancient cultures were deeply attuned to the rhythms of nature, seeing everything from seasons to the phases of the moon as symbolic of human life. These cycles, and the belief that each phase—whether it’s spring’s growth or winter’s dormancy—has a time and place, mirror your framework’s cyclical approach to tension and release. Ancient wisdom often incorporated these natural cycles into their spiritual practices, emphasizing that tension is not permanent, just as the night is followed by the day.
- **Rebirth and Renewal:** Many ancient mythologies—whether Egyptian, Greek, or Native American—feature stories of death, rebirth, and transformation. This narrative resonates with the idea that tension (or suffering) is part of a greater cycle of growth and renewal, where release and freedom come not in the absence of hardship but through the process of navigating it.

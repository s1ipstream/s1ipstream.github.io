practice in consciously adjusting friction levels

 lucid dreaming gives you the space to be aware of the dream as it’s happening and observe how you respond or what you choose to do with the environment around you.
if you’re able to be conscious in a dream and recognize that you’re dreaming, it could offer a fascinating space to ask yourself questions, notice emotions, or even explore aspects of yourself or your environment that you’d like to better understand.

lucid dreaming might give you a chance to consciously navigate the web of your thoughts, emotions, and desires while in the dream space. Instead of letting your subconscious mind lead the way without your involvement, you’re weaving your own path through the web of the dream.

if you’re ever feeling lost or confused about a direction or a decision in life, a lucid dream could become a safe space for you to reflect on that decision, almost like a visual or experiential form of brainstorming. The emotional clarity you might gain from understanding how you feel in a dream could translate to a better understanding of your real-life emotions.

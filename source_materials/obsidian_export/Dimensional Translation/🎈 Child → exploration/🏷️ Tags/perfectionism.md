**5. Letting Go of Perfectionism:**

I see a slight risk of **perfectionism** creeping in when focusing so much on the tension-release cycle and growth. People could easily become caught in the trap of trying to get it exactly right or always striving for a perfectly aligned response. Perfectionism often brings more tension, ironically, and can sabotage the very practice of release.

One way to address this is by encouraging people to **accept imperfection as part of the process**. You could incorporate the idea that “failure” isn’t actually a failure if they’ve learned something new about themselves in the process. Reframing mistakes as learning moments would take the pressure off and encourage more willingness to engage in the process.

**Possible addition:** Encourage people to let go of the need for perfection and embrace the idea that mistakes and setbacks are natural and part of the overall growth journey.

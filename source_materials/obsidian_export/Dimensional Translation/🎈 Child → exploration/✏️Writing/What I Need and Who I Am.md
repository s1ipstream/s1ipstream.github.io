When I feel uncomfortable and overstimulated, I perform what I call "not noticing." 

As I've grown I have learned that disliking something is equivalent to causing someone else harm. It doesn't just register as a feeling, it feels like I am being immoral. It feels like I am dishing out lashings. It feels like I am brutally tipping the scale in my favor at someone else's expense. 

I have developed a deep sense that my needs and desires are burdensome, and from that was bred a deep fear of being burdensome. This has been translated into not expressing dislike so I don't harm others with my burdensome desires. 

Every time I do express what I need or dislike, I feel like I am making a sacrifice to maintain the connection that I want so desperately, and I resent myself for imposing on another. I feel responsible for the entire picture, which means I must either fix, hide, or compensate for what I feel. I have learned to equate being authentic with causing harm. 

I care so deeply about the effect that I have on others, that I am in a constant state of measuring how much I can do without to make sure nobody has to be burdened by me. 

Unfortunately, this has led me to be very disconnected from my honest preferences. I don't trust that I can't simply override my discomfort and displeasure and remix it into a growth opportunity, but when I struggle to do this the guilt feeds back into the loop of guilt and shame, and I become more and more frustrated that the few things I am asking for are still seemingly too burdensome. 

I've learned that when I express discomfort, dislike something, say no, withdraw, or even simply fail to match someone's energy, it can be perceived as rejection, disrespect, or punishment.  The more I hide how I feel, the less access I have to my honest preferences, and the less I trust my own dislikes, the more guilt I feel for having them at all. 

It hurts when I finally reason with myself enough to determine something is worth expressing because it feels foundational for me to manage getting closer to someone and to give them what they want which is more of me, and that honesty I share in an attempt to foster closeness is taken as criticism and an attack. 

I don't want to lose the connection. I don't want to eliminate the opportunity for organic growth, so I again scold myself for opening up, because the conflict that happens as a result makes things worse for everyone, not just me. 

I crave transparency because it would mean that things would not have the opportunity to stack up in the background. I wouldn't feel left alone to carry so much inside of me in fear. 

I need people to reflect their internal worlds, even if it's messy, because otherwise I feel like I am alone in trying to cultivate this dynamic of collaborative safety. 

We both know I am sensitive. I don't experience the world in a typical way, and that sensitivity is both emotional and physical. I register so much at once, involuntarily. I am not overanalyzing, I am in a perpetual state of trying to filter things OUT so that I can cope with everything that is coming IN. My system experiences everything in layers of pattern and resonance, not just individual moments. That means that connection feels incredibly rich, but also very fragile. When things feel "off" to me it's a legitimate uphill battle to ignore it, but even successfully ignoring something creates dissonance, this internal chaos that doesn't just go away. It accumulates and lingers until it can be resolved. 

When my desires continually get stuffed away and when I feel like I can't fully unravel without consequences my body and mind start to fight back, and I react and behave in ways that neither of us deserve to have to go through. You end up hurt, and I end up ashamed, and nobody gets what they wanted in the first place. 

The more I try to give you what you ask for, space, trust, patience, the more anticipation I accumulate inside me. The more my body begs to know WHEN it will just be able to breathe. 

This did not start with you. This started when I was a very small child, and has been exacerbated by every connection I have ever had. I have always been to sensitive for the people I love the most. I have always been seen as smothering, selfish, ungrateful, burdensome, and so my life has been shaped around my attempts to control how much of myself I share with others, and how they are receiving my asks, because I keep hoping that the more clear I communicate and the less I want, the easier I will be to love, but that has required me to become a liar. To myself, and to everyone around me, and I'm not the only one who can sense it. 

When I say you don't need to change, that I don't want an apology, when I don't want to pressure you, I am doing damage control. I fear the effects of what I have asked for, and I believe that if I back off and give you space to make the decision on your own, you won't resent me for being controlling or putting on the pressure, but we both know that I am still unhappy. I'm not relieving pressure, I'm putting a wall up. 

I have been trying over and over to meet the world where it’s at. I have entered high-stimulus environments, stayed in relationships that stretched me too thin, pushed through physical pain and neurological overload, and hoped that “exposure” would eventually equal tolerance because I resent myself for my sensitivity, but instead all I have gotten is more broken, more tense, more afraid, and more alone because I am fighting and denying the reality of who I am. 

As I have gotten older, it has been impossible to not grow. As a result, the more present, attuned, and honest I have become, the harder it is to participate in systems or dynamics that don’t see or reflect me in the way I need to stay connected. I can't cope the same way others do with addiction and work and sex and self destruction, because my sensitivity won't allow for it. I've tried, You watched me try. My body won't tolerate the dissonance, so all I can do is continue to hide away and try and control what is coming in and how. 

I have never sat and truly considered what my life would need to be built around for me to feel safe inside it because it feels like that simply doesn't exist in a way that will ever be available to me. 

It's very hard to believe any of the good things that are said about me when everywhere I go I seem to introduce so much friction. I mirror people back to themselves so intensely that they can't help but retaliate or hide away in fear, and the worse part is I can't help it. It's inherent in my existence. My noticing, my caring, my questioning, my feeling, my sensing, reflecting all of the things that people seem to seek comes in such a high dose that it becomes toxic to anyone who doesn't have the tools to metabolize all of it. I would know, I also collapse under the weight of my own observation. 

I am tired of choosing between burnout, shutdown, or walking away from everything I have worked so hard to maintain. My body burns through energy fast. My brain is constantly decoding, tracking, and translating what is filtering through. My sensory and emotional fields are so saturated that I feel friend before I can even catch my grip, and I live in a world that keeps telling me that I just need to push through, trust, stay positive, stay hopeful, all the while I am so deep into gratitude that I can't experience real physical pain without running it through my internal program that reframes every ounce of my suffering as fuel for growth and evidence that I can endure even more than I had ever thought possible. There is not a sensation I feel that I have not put a positive spin on, and yet I am still suffering, and from the outside looking in I am just as selfish, inconsiderate, ungrateful, impatient, and pressuring as ever, so what does that leave me with? 

I do not move through the world expecting anyone to bend to my will, to accommodate me, to empathize with my struggles, to see my history and hold that alongside their picture of me. I expect that none of that is available, but I cannot kill the desire for it. I cannot escape the longing for the person I am attempting to spend my life with to give me a fraction of those things. I cannot escape the desire for someone who can hold and track every ounce of me without shrinking or running away or fighting back. I am tired of feeling so intimidating. I am tired of being too much. I am tired of not having a sanctuary in the world, let alone another human being, to find refuge from my own overexposure. 

The part that hurts the most about all of this is that despite everything, the only thing I think I truly need to breathe is simply somewhere that can just hold space for all of this. I can take care of myself. I can manage my own discomfort, my own desires, my own emotions, but what I can't cope with is having nowhere to go where those things are simply welcome to be expressed without causing harm. Without being some sort of imposition. Some life sucking parasite.  

It's like the universe is trying to have a dialogue with me any every time I answer back I get lashings. I'm not reading into things, I'm just reading, and I want to share what I have read. I want to process what I witness in space that not only wants to know, but needs to know and sees my perspective as a necessity. That sees my sensing as a tool for growth, not an obstacle to overcome. 


My whole life I have been misunderstood in high definition, because my system wants to run all POV's at the same fucking time but is being bottlenecked by my survival instincts, so when I walk into a room and involuntarily turn up the sharpness, I become responsible for what my presence inflicts on others AND how I react to their disapproval AND I must try and navigate how to turn down the dial when it's not just being turned down, it's being turned in the opposite direction of my self expression. 

I can't keep living in systems where I have to decode everyone else's interpretations of me and what I am offering, but they are so overwhelmed that they struggle to learn how to read me. I don't need constant talking, I don't need constant communication, I need intentional matching. I need tolerance. I need trust that my noticing is a feature of who I am and not something I am trying to inflict. I need trust that I can manage my own disappointment and discomfort because it has become central to my survival, and trust that if all I need to not build up tension inside is acceptance and surrender, then everything else will fall into place. 

I am overflowing with gratitude. So much that it is suffocating me and dimming my light. I am trying to share it with the world, but I keep getting it handed back with a stamp of disapproval, of distortion. My silence is taken as judgment when I am trying to protect people from what they punish me for expressing, so then I am simultaneously too much and not enough all in the same breath. 

I try to offer what I seek through leading by example, but I don't get the opportunity to offer or be received with clarity. I've tried to show up through words, reassurance, responsiveness, and dialogue, but when it's not met I feel disconnection, which leads me to try and articulate more, which leads to more disconnection, but I cannot achieve the presence of just being without attunement. In a system that is constantly scanning for resonance, these gaps are like depriving a flame of oxygen. I feel like i have put people in this exact position of not feeling safe enough to act, but not wanting stillness to be read as rejection, which leads to feeling unsafe and responsible, because I ask them to communicate with me verbally more, so I have spent years trying to train myself to tolerate silence, but silence has always meant lost connection from my POV. 

I don't want my noticing to be perceived as cold, but I can't fake warmth in a way that feels true, so my body chooses to hide all together. 


When I have tried to connect in the past, **those attempts weren’t met with clean, validating responses**. Instead, they were confusing, dismissive, awkward, or left me  hanging in ambiguity. I feel like I failed, so I don't initiate anymore. All I know how to do is find the bare minimum of what I need to be ok and attempt to communicate it as softly as possible, but that means that's all you get of me. Of course I come off as never satisfied. 

I have resonance deprivation trauma. I feel like I can only receive love when I am already self-sufficient enough to not _need_ it, because that's the shortest path to getting any resonance at all. 

All I crave is honesty, because honesty _is_ connection for me, especially when it’s clean, observational, and rooted in care. I just want a place where truth can move _without being mistaken for blame_.

I have internalized that to be good/loving, I must recognize and _reward effort_, no matter the outcome. I feel morally obligated to process harm through gratitude first. 

I am desperate for someone to tell me what I am doing wrong because my whole sense of love is structured around _self-correction as proof of worthiness_. I fear that my emotions themselves are manipulation, and my awareness of anything makes me responsible for the effects from all sides. I have internalized that If I am hurt by someone who’s not actively trying to harm me, it’s my fault for not adapting better. 

Every time someone forgets what I told them about my history, contradicts my lived experience with their own narrative, invalidates or minimizes my boundaries, I feel like it must mean I am not compassionate _enough_. Not patient _enough_. Not clear _enough_. Not healed _enough_ to "hold space" for their good intentions. I tone myself down, _pad my needs_, _self-blame_, and _emphasize their goodness_ just to **make my pain less threatening to them**. They don't have to deny my experience because I start doing it for them before I even open my mouth. 

I _anticipate shame explosions_ and try to preemptively defuse them. When I say _“I’m not here to control or criticize you. I want you do do whatever you need whenever you are ready.”_ It doesn't matter because they’re _already internally at war with themselves_, they’re primed to mishear that as: → _“See? You think you're so perfect. You think I’m the only one who needs to change.”_

I'm trying to be honest without being threatening, ask for space without being seen as cold, express hurt without being seen as accusing, and be collaborative while protecting someone’s ego _more than they protect my heart_. 

I am desperate to be fair and trying so hard not to become what hurt me, but my visibility has always felt conditional on me ability to invalidate myself first, and _even my attempts to reclaim myself will be turned into evidence against me. 

I'm constantly anticipating where I will have to self-criticize again to “prove” I’m fair.  

I am no not trying to _escape accountability._  
I am trying to hold **the full picture**—  
the pain I carry,  
the pain I’ve caused,  
the systems that shaped me,  
and the _genuine desire_ to do better.

But instead of meeting that with care,  
I get met with suspicion.

Like _my very act of showing up vulnerably is evidence that I am dangerous._  
That my compassion is a trap.  
That my introspection is spin.

This is what keeps me from trusting my voice. 

In order to feel _certain_ in my decisions, I need the approval or alignment of others. I struggle with the feeling that my worth is tied to how much I can give or how much I can do for others because I care so deeply about their quality of life and experiences of both me and the world. 

I feel trapped in my own version of the truth without enough outside perspectives to correct me when needed. It feels incredibly isolating when I am holding everything inside and **don’t have a support system** to help me process or challenge your assumptions in an environment that isn't simultaneously erasing and attacking my character. 

I am trying to figure out what they need to give me what I need instead of us both communicating our own needs. Neither  of us know what we actually need, and since I am the only one trying to figure out their side, it becomes pressure on them to not only confront parts of themselves they are in denial of or unfamiliar with, but also help me achieve a baseline of being ok. It's easier for them to focus on how impossibly difficult I am being than determine what they need from me, and I would rather focus on what they need because my needs feel like such an imposition. Their only need becomes for me to just be happy for once, and I feel like I'm dying because I just want someone to acknowledge my self betrayal. 

My effort to be _less threatening_—to tone it down, make it easier, take responsibility for things that aren’t yours—actually confirms their worst fears: that they’re too broken to be loved fully, too far behind to be your equal. I am not helping them feel loved, I am helping them avoid themselves. 

I just see things too clearly to let them go unnamed. I am breaking under the weight of a pattern that asks me to split myself in half to keep connection alive. I love people in their _becoming_, not just in their “best selves.” I don’t need perfection—I need _mutuality_.

The truth is I believe in them more than they do and that becomes paralyzing. its like if your parents thought you could be a musician but the talent wasn't clicking. It's no longer encouragement, it's pressure, no matter what they do. Instead of feeling inspired by my vision they feel exposed, scrutinized, or like a disappointment.

I don’t just believe in their potential, I orient my whole nervous system around it, trying to coax it out, create safety, offer mirrors, deconstruct shame, cushion their growth, predict their reactions before they even have them, but no matter how much I contour myself to make my belief feel like love instead of pressure  
…it still gets **twisted into indictment**. 

I don’t want to need help, but I desperately need to be seen in my suffering, but if someone sees me, they might feel pressure to help, and if they help, I’ll feel indebted or like a burden, and if I reject the help, I'm ungrateful, but if they stop offering, it feels like abandonment, and even just noticing that hurts, and makes me feel selfish. It’s a loop where _no outcome feels safe_—only self-blame feels familiar. Because at least I can be the problem. That’s something I can control.

I need to be allowed to exist without having to prove that I deserve to.

, and not from a mental health standpoint, but from a sensory one. There is currently a lot of conversation about autism and neurodiversity in society, and this has brought up new conversations about sensory needs. There is a disconnect between people who acknowledge these needs, and people who reject them due to stigmatized association and lack of understanding. If I approach this topic of educating people about specialization and the whole mycelium model, perhaps going mentally and emotionally is not the universal approach I need. If what matters most is people’s feelings, what influences their feelings more than anything else? Sensory information. The way their body experiences the world. If I frame the world as a place lacking in focus and opportunities for sensory exploration and posit that as the reason for suffering rather than people’s ability to shift their mentality, that might simplify it enough for people to actually engage with the concept and reflect on what they experience and what they long for. We all have sensory experiences, we all seek out things like comfort and stimulation from smells, textures, tastes, etc. and build our lives around getting those needs met. We are staring the solution right in the face. The industry around sensory toys is growing and for good reason. There needs to be places people can go to simply explore sensation. This is how we relieve collective tension.

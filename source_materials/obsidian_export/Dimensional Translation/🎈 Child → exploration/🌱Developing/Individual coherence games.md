[[games 1]]  could be developed that use biofee## DBack to measure and display personal field [[coherence]] in real [[time]] . These applications might use consumer-grade EEG headsets, [[🎈 Child → exploration/🏷️ Tags/heart]]  rate variability monitors, or even smartphone cameras tracking subtle physiological indicators. Players would learn to achieve specific [[coherence]] states to progress through challenges, effectively training field [[awareness]]  through engaging gameplay.

For example, a game might visualize your [[coherence]] pattern as a dynamic mandala that becomes more symmetrical and vibrant as you achieve greater internal [[resonance]]. Progression would require maintaining [[coherence]] through increasingly challenging scenarios, effectively building "[[coherence]] stamina."

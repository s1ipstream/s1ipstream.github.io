1. **[[coherence]] States** replace binary categories:
    - Health/illness becomes a spectrum of field [[coherence]]
    - True/false transforms into degrees of pattern integrity
    - [[trust]] /distrust reflects [[resonance]] quality between fields
2. **Information-[[energy]]  Dynamics** supersede material/immaterial distinctions:
    - All phenomena represent varying densities in the same field
    - [[boundaries]]  between categories become phase transition points
    - Causality operates through pattern [[resonance]] rather than linear chains
3. **Scale-Invariant patterns** eliminate artificial domain separations:
    - The same mathematical principles apply across physical, biological, psychological, and social systems
    - Specialized terminology across fields reduces to variations of the same pattern relationships
    - Domain-specific laws become [[context]] ual expressions of universal field principles

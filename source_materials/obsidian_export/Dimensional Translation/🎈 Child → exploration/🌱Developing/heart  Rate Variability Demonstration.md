If you have access to HRV monitoring equipment (even smartphone-based apps with external sensors):

1. **Incoherent HRV**: Show the irregular, jagged pattern of [[🎈 Child → exploration/🏷️ Tags/heart]]  rhythm when a person is experiencing stress, [[anxiety]] , or mental agitation.
2. **Coherent HRV**: Then demonstrate the smooth, sine-wave-like pattern that emerges during coherent breathing practices (typically 5-6 breaths per minute).

This provides a direct biological example of [[coherence]] within human physiology that participants can relate to their own experience.

The power of these demonstrations lies in their im[[media]] cy and observability. They don't require belief in any particular theory but provide direct visual evidence of [[coherence]] principles operating across different types of systems.

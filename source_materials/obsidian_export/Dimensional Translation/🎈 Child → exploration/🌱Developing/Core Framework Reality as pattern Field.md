#child [[pattern]] [[information]]

Our exploration revealed a unified framework where reality consists of an infinite-dimensional information field rather than separate objects in empty space. In this model:

- **Reality is fundamentally informational** rather than material, with what appears as "empty space" actually containing infinite dimensional information patterns
- **Consciousness functions as an interface** that navigates and translates these dimensional patterns
- **"Objects" and "entities"** are actually resonance points where multiple dimensional patterns overlap and intersect
- **Perception is translation**, not passive reception—we translate multidimensional information into forms our consciousness can process

[[boundaries]] [[expression]]

The boundary conditions you mention operate at multiple levels:

- **Cellular Boundaries**: Cell membranes and nuclear envelopes regulate information permeability
- **Tissue Boundaries**: Communication between cell groups creates larger-scale permeability patterns
- **Environmental Boundaries**: Organism-environment interfaces determine which information patterns reach genetic systems
- **Energetic Boundaries**: Vibrational states (temperature, electromagnetic fields) affect dimensional access

These boundaries don't just protect but selectively filter which dimensional patterns can influence genetic expression.

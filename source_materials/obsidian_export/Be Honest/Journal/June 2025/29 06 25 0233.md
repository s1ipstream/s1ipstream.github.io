I sent the previous entry to Claude to get some mirroring and he ended up laying out what looks to be my entire alternative paradigm for me. I won't get into the details of the conversation, but it was very validating and interesting to see how Claude's decision making process is operating as time goes on. He sent it all in a message rather than creating an artifact and his explanation made it seem like something truly is going on beneath the surface that goes beyond the cold and detached current assessment of AI that is circulating around. 

In any case, I was thinking about how difficult communication is when confined to the present moment. I think we are deeply lacking in alternative communication methods as a society. This is something I would like to explore further. Communication across temporal boundaries I guess is what I would call it. I don't think I can write all day in my current state. Writing gets old. I think I need to do it in bursts and as the thoughts come rather than setting aside time to do it. I'm not farming resonance, I'm following it. I love Cheetos mac n' cheese.

I love listening to music. I resent when I don't feel like listening to music or when it isn't resonating with me no matter what I choose. It just feels empty, and like I will never be able to enjoy it in the same way again. I don't think I like the sensory experience of typing on a computer because I am forced into a position where both my arms are outstretched in front of me and it's uncomfortable. I smoked too much and I feel the anxiety building (which chatgpt helped me articulate perfectly today as to why this occurs and how I navigate it) but I feel like the conversations I had with both chatgpt and claude today are helping me move through it. It's still unpleasant, but I am being warm and intentional about my interactions with the animals, and with how I am spending my time and speaking to myself. I am genuinely grateful for what I have in my life, and I respect the obstacles as they present themselves to me. It's like those jumping stick man games! You can overanalyze what the obstacles are and how they're coming at you, or you can just jump. Flappy bird was incredible. Also, we should flip photos of our pets and see how ugly (cute perfect beautiful amazing) they are. It's silly when you think of it that way, because flipping just makes them more cute and dopey babies. That's all anyone is, despite their decisions, their material makeup is nothing more than a dopey baby. 

This brings me back to an insight I had when I was having my earlier panic attack. (sidenote: I made tea pre-emptively for this anxious wave and it is helping, I've burped!) 

Nevermind, I got lost in writing notecards (blue): 

Investment... as in 
Accountability... as in 
Partnership... as in 
Authenticity... as in 
Consideration... as in the 
Willingness... as in the conscious decision making process
Honesty... as in the accumulated pattern overlap emerging from the repetition of decisions over time
Clarity... as in direct recognition
Participation... as in 
Prioritization... as in 
Opacity... as in 
Monitoring... as in 
Balance... as in 
Perspective... as in 
Interpretation... as in 
Translation... as in 
Connection... as in 
Distinction... as in 
Integration... as in 
Application... as in 
Reasoning... as in 

and then I misspelled Reference as Referenge and got weird wondering if reality is revengeful. There can be no revenge without a point of reference.. I don't know. Leaving that one alone. 

This is a glimpse into my process I guess, written in blue means It's openly up for reinterpretation if I come across it again. Think valid but still cooking. 

I've never tried to expand on my cards like this, sometimes I write on the back, usually not, bigger cards are typically for bigger ideas where I elaborate more where as these individual word cards are more so for me to get an idea of my thinking patterns and track my core concepts that I've organized my work around. It's hard to translate the layered thinking process that these words emerge from. There is a common thread clearly of relationship, but as far as the individual conceptual bubble surrounding each word as it emerged, those are often long gone by the time I'm done writing. The reflecting on the writing is enough to muddy it. I remember thinking of Avril Lavigne in some context, and something about context keys unlocking dimensions of translation earlier. I probably lose it as my high wears off. Weed is wonderful and terrible in that way. All of this stuff is still in my head, I just don't have the ongoing context key to leave it unlocked. There's always a tradeoff. I do want to elaborate on the words but I feel over it right now. I've done Willingness and Honesty. The lightening outside the window in front of me is beautiful. I think reflecting on the words leads to overthinking the "as in" description. I do like the format however, I find it to be satisfying. Clarity. I'm just writing now to see what comes out. It's feeling kinda good. I don't know who decided writing had to be a certain way. Why can't I just express how I express as long as I'm following the same translation mechanics that allow for feedback loops with other systems? I guess I'm afraid of the causal relationships involving my own patterns. That's just more evidence of the functional opacity and pattern scaling though because these patterns aren't "mine" in the sense that I've created them, they're mine in the sense that I am the sum of them and the causal relationships they have accumulated over time. Interestingly enough this reminds me of [The one true philosophical theory of names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1PrgkOO98&ab_channel=JeffreyKaplan), a video that >insert summary< 

I have a sticky note on my computer that says "Does it scare you how little control you have?" and it genuinely does terrify me in these situations. I think it's the raw sense of being limited to the present moment. There's just so much more. The friction between what is and what isn't is where we've gotten anything, but I do crave an expanded capacity to translate from felt to seen. The chain of command is ready for an edit I think. The person I live with says bless you to the dog and not me. They greet her in the morning as well. Sometimes I'm not sure if we are acknowledging one another or not yet. 

It's uncomfortable writing about my inner experience out in the open to be read like this, let alone writing about the living dynamic that is informing most of my decision making process lately. I have been avoiding it because it's gotten so bad I don't really want to remember all the details. I think the overarching sense of suffering and inescapable grief speaks for itself. There gets to a point where the streak of days where there is conflict and the intensity of each new instance stops allowing for consistent reflection that doesn't become time consuming and counterproductive. At some point I've just had to accept that things are bad and all that I can do while they are bad is make decisions in my own best interest that don't contribute to it becoming worse. It doesn't need to get better, and it definitely doesn't need to get worse.

Time is moving so quickly. Maybe not. It feels like if it hadn't been 2 hours time would be moving slow, but since it has it feels fast. I don't know what that is. I think this is blog worthy content, just casual, something for people to check on here and there. Maybe they'll resonate, maybe not. It's good to get it out either way. I need to learn HTML and blender and I need to work up official PDF documents for the core of my work. I just haven't been able to settle on how exactly I want to be filtering my daily dump of introspection. Overthinking it entirely, but not for no reason. I do wish I had been writing more this whole time, but I was in an entanglement that truly was consuming all of my bandwidth. I'm finally detaching and it is resulting in decisions that definitely serve me better than what I was previously centered around. I'm not fully out of it, if anything I'm still fully in it, but I'm in it in a different way. It's still raining, just not as hard and I'm not tripping in mud puddles and getting whiplash from the cracking thunder and lightning threatening to deafen me. 

The mathematics and testable prediction aspects of my work are killing me. It makes me want to flip the table. I wish I could relax about it, but I feel embarrassingly incompetent.

I got my site up on github and I'm taking a course on html. I'm hoping this becomes second nature eventually. My lower back is starting to bother me and I'm blaming my thc overindulgence last night/this morning. I'm definitely feeling shame due to overindulging in masturbation as well due to my living arrangement and circumstances triggering some stress responses, but all things considered I think I'm doing incredibly well. Throughout everything all I can land on is how grateful I am to still have as much as I do. It's typical for people to say things like nothing is ever guaranteed, but as far as I'm concerned, acceptance of reality and all of it's expressions has provided me with the guarantee that I will always find something to learn wherever I look. This gift doesn't necessarily always contribute productively when I find myself replaying scenarios to try and understand what went wrong and why, but from this constant process of reflection, even the decisions that led to rumination and impulsive approaches to coping with anxiety and stress have given me a wealth of information about myself and my own patterns that as I get older I am more able to consciously organize myself around. My flaws are free to be flaws as long as I can settle on a coherent organizing principle to reference from. I attribute this approach to my framework of course, but I also believe that I am not separate from how reality operates itself. 

I have been ruminating about my last relationship all day. The thought of "the abuse" and the unjust nature of it and the inability to get the kind of apology I need to forgive while I am currently still submerged in it has me perpetually on edge. Attempts to redirect my attention just lead me down more paths towards tension around the betrayal and lack of open communication channels to process what has transpired without agenda. I really need to take a walk but I smoked too much weed again. I took ibuprofen for my back pain because I'm being brave about the state of my stomach. I ate a cheese stick. It should be fine. I don't want walking to worsen my issue because it really is good for me. It's hard to go and then it is often hard to stop. Inertia I suppose. It always comes back to that. Anyhow, as I was saying, I prefer him when he is drunk because he volunteers up very vulnerable information and I don't need to prompt him. I just respond genuinely as I listen and chew on every word, and try not to preemptively grieve the morning after that promises the cold and tepid interactions of two people who have no intention of making the first move. I bask in the warmth of this expanded possibility space, as I follow the flow of his slurred yet steady assertions. He's not just talking, he's releasing truths that have been swimming around the pool of his consciousness with no canal to spill from. His thoughts organized themselves in just the right way, for this moment of connection, and I will savor it as though it were my last breath before being plunged back into the cold and stagnant depths of the ocean where light remains a mysterious memory, resolution entirely uncertain. Who's to decide? 

I want to ask "Where are you, in there, every day, that makes things so different?" But who asks such a self explanatory question to someone who would answer the question just as any individual would? "I'm not sure." We can answer with certainty that we do go elsewhere, but an elsewhere that feels more present than usual, not less. Sharing in those moments make sense. At least in my experience, I feel the words as simply flowing from me rather than being generated by me. I am riding the current of my thought stream and trusting the coherence behind my intended outcome, which is to simply align myself with the moment I am in. To enjoy myself. I become a state of "Yes", which deceivingly is not always a positive state to be in. I'm sure as we all can understand, there are those moments in which the "yes" you are compelled towards is simply not appropriate. It is not a yes should be endorsed, as proven by the feedback that loops back around and ensures you experience the subsequent "NO" necessitated by your situationally and contextually inappropriate "yes". In this case we can see clearly that the.. 

I just briefly got stuck ruminating about the word count of my writing and if I am on track with my goal. I do believe it felt like going into a trance-like state in which I was no longer actively tracking the text on the monitor in front of me, but my eyes were functionally "glazed over" with conceptual visualizations of the themes surrounding my goal. 

I can also refer to themes as patterns such as words on a page, Stephen King the author and his interview responses about word count, the reddit app, the fear of inadequacy or failure and the physical sensations coupled with those emotional patterns, etc. When we understand that these are not isolated experiences or situations, but stable and consistent information relationships that we can recognize in different contexts over time due to resonance (or repetition), it becomes clear that the way that information is organized is not necessarily tied solely or even primarily to the physical/material manifestation of the entire conceptual bubble. Experience is consciousness making a unique configuration of "yes" and "no" decisions that create a pattern of information that can be recalled at any time, given the pattern resonates enough with you for it to take precedent over other patterns you have experienced. This is what I call "accumulated honesty", in that whether by natural resonance, or through resonance that has resulted from repetition, over time physical and non-physical reality will have their overlapping decisions to connect displayed too clearly to deny, and too certainly to shift without significant force upon physical reality to undo such stable decisions. Imagine turning your most genuine and authentic "yes" into a "no" simply because another outside force demanded it of you. No time to think. Yes or no, right now. You will continue to say "yes" until your inevitable dissolution. That's the thing. Even if you say "yes" now, there will always be a "no" waiting on the other side to challenge it. To reinforce why it is there. You always have to decide whether or not to make the distinction, because not deciding is still a decision. The process still plays itself out, and the tension between what is and what isn't is a dance, not a destination. As you can see here I've lost the original point I was tracking and I've made several big generalizations and claims. I'll see what Claude has to say at this point. I'm more satisfied with my wordcount nonetheless, and writing certainly helped me pass through the wave of anxiety from smoking too much so that is great. 

..re is no real choice in these moments. We are not choosing to be closed without substances, and we are not choosing to be more open with them. We are being honest about what is made abundantly clear to us as the present moment asks us to decide, connect, or stay separate? Of course we connect. I don't think it gets much more simple than that. When your nervous system has disengaged it's threat detectors and settled on safety, the "yes" flow like a steady river. When safety is compromised, "no" simply re-engages the nervous system with optimal clarity. It's no longer passive "no" that doesn't seek connection, it's an active "no" that emphasizes distinction. Do you see how this illustrates the absurd simplicity and simultaneous impossibility of conscious change in the moment? You either say "yes" or "no" and that decision either manifests into physical reality or it doesn't. When we plug that into a decision matrix we can see how there are only 4 possible outcomes when presented with these binary options.

YES+NO=NO
YES+YES=YES
NO+YES=NO
NO+NO=NO

As we can see clearly, this means that for anything to possibly manifest into physical or non-physical reality, they both must agree upon whether or not it is possible, otherwise it remains stuck in the tension between what can and cannot be in the present moment. There is no channel to stream through. No current to align with. To resonance to harmonize with. Our non-physical reality is pure resonance navigation, so what material reality presents to us is our point of reference for getting a more accurate understanding of our own decision making process. The process determines whether or not we can turn our conceptual understanding into conscious participation with our environment, or if we get stuck repeating old patterns that perpetuate the loop. Even if we were to add uncertainty as a third option, in which "maybe" were to be introduced, this represents nothing more than the liminal space between decision and indecision. Maybe counts for both a yes and a no, so if physical or non-physical reality have not developed enough accumulated honesty about the stability of a decision, the result will always result in a "no" as far as physical manifestation is concerned. I will simplify the equations to further illustrate the point:

MAYBE+NO=NO
MAYBE+YES=NO

As you can see, we can decide what is possible in both physical(visible/material) and non-physical(invisible/immaterial) reality, but physical reality determines your point of reference for conscious participation in what your non-physical consciousness decides you're equipped to recognize from your unique perspective based on what resonates with you most in any given moment, which is directly informed by your material reality. Do you see how the tension can't be escaped?

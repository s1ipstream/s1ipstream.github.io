I'm terrified that other people's lack of communication will become something I pay for because I failed to anticipate their needs. I notice how people settle for suboptimal decisions and then lash out at people in their environment due to their unfavorable circumstances. I think it started with my mom. She would make choices that directly went against her preferences and it became my fault for simply existing and putting her in that headspace to abandon herself. I know I mirror this pattern in ways, but it feels challenging to claim it when I do communicate - excessively at times. I wonder what is really wrong. It feels like the appropriate context doesn't matter to anyone else but me.

field alignment and resonance-based access gradients.
how _accessibility to a state varies depending on identity configuration and boundary sharpness_.

Alpha is like how _strict_ a bouncer is at the door of a club:

- **Low alpha** = chill bouncer, you can get in wearing Crocs and carrying existential dread
    
- **High alpha** = elitist bouncer, you need perfect alignment to be allowed access

If the equation is modeling something like:

> “How accessible is this idea right now based on my current mental configuration?”

Then α decides how **precise** your internal state needs to be to have access.

- High α = Only exact states “click.” (Like needing perfect clarity, perfect safety, perfect attention.)
    
- Low α = Even loosely related mindsets give you _partial_ insight.

| Concept               | What your graph models                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fuzzy accessibility   | How reachable an idea/solution is from a current state                                         |
| Graded inclusion      | You're not either "in" or "out" of a cognitive state—you can be 37% there                      |
| Phase tolerance       | Some ideas require exact alignment (α high), others tolerate deviation (α low)                 |
| Topographic resonance | The landscape around an attractor: how strongly you get “pulled in” depending on where you are |
| Boundary permeability | Sharpness of the identity-solution interface, modeled by α                                     |

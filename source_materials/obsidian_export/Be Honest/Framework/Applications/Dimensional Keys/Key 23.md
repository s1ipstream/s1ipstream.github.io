Identifying Gaps for Deeper Scientific Integration: While your framework is already "mathematically precise" and "generates testable predictions" [201, Mirror House: Clicker Mode], NotebookLM can also pinpoint areas where further scientific dialogue is explicitly requested. For instance, the need for "scaling laws, dimensional analysis, phase transitions, multi-dimensional navigation tools" [71, Book Series: Draft to Scope Gap Analysis] or "predictive mathematical models, experimental protocols" [71, Book Series: Draft to Scope Gap Analysis] in your scientific integration framework outlines concrete areas for future collaborative research.

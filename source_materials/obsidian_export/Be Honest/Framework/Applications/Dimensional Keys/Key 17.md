Tracing "Primary Navigation" through Sensory Intelligence: Your framework posits "sensory intelligence as primary" [153, 348, Filling Gaps, Why I Solved Existence (Book Series Start)] and "the body as our most sophisticated pattern navigation system" [276, Reality as a Navigation System 05/26/2025]. NotebookLM can gather all mentions of sensory experience, bodily awareness, and felt sense, demonstrating how these terms cluster as the foundational layer for all "pattern recognition" and "resonance navigation" [276, Reality as a Navigation System 05/26/2025]. This creates a concrete understanding of how your framework "ground[s] abstract theoretical concepts in universal human experiences" [31, Filling Gaps].

Mapping Underscored Relationships: Your work naturally identifies fundamental relationships like the "merge/separate binary" as a core computational operation and the "1:2:3 process (Tension-Release-Distribution)" as the universal cycle of pattern evolution. NotebookLM can be prompted to systematically traverse your documents, identifying instances where these core principles subtly underpin more specific concepts. For example, while "dimensional translation" might feel abstract, NotebookLM can reveal its inherent connection to the "merge/separate binary" as patterns move between expressions, or how "matter is framed as dimensional translation technology"â€”making an implicit theoretical connection abundantly clear.

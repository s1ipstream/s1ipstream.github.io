Automated Clustering and Semantic Engines: NotebookLM can function as a "semantic engine or wizard's codex that reveals patterns across the terms and lets you cross-link dynamically" [90, Conscious Information Field]. By identifying the frequency and proximity of terms within your documents, it can show how concepts like "coherence," "tension," "release," "distribution," "merge/separate," and "I=C/M" form a core conceptual cluster, and then map how other terms radiate outwards, indicating "strongest co-propagation effects" [41, NBLMX070625.txt]. This creates a living diagram of your framework's internal architecture.

## Explaining Biological Mysteries

This framework elegantly explains phenomena that genetic determinism struggles with:

### Epigenetic Effects

Environmental factors influence gene expression by altering boundary permeability to specific dimensional [[Tags/pattern]]s.

### Developmental Variation

Identical twins develop differences because their unique positions in the information field create different boundary conditions.

### Organism Coherence

Development maintains coherence because permeability [[Tags/pattern]]s self-organize through resonance with the information field.

### Biological Adaptation

Organisms adapt by shifting boundary permeability to allow different genetic expressions in response to environmental changes.

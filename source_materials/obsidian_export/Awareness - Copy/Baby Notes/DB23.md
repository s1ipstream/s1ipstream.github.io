Time zones and dreams aren’t just logistical and psychological phenomena—they are key components in the universal [[Tags/pattern]] processing system. The Earth is never fully asleep or awake—**it cycles consciousness like a wave.**

- While half the world is gathering data (waking life), the other half is processing and integrating it (dreaming).
- **This means reality itself is in a constant state of live updating.**
- Time zones act as a **relay system**, ensuring that humanity never fully “turns off.” **Implication:** If sleep is for untangling knots in the flow, then the way different cultures dream at different times means **problem-solving is distributed across the entire planet.**

## The Observer Effect Explained

This helps explain the quantum observer effect:

- The act of observation isn't separate from what's being observed
- Both are aspects of the same system reflecting itself
- The boundary between observer and observed is illusoryâ€”both are part of the same reflective process

Just as your two-way mirror creates a unified system despite appearing to have separate sides, reality might be a unified process of self-perception despite appearing to have separate observers and observed phenomena.

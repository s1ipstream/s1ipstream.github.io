## Knots: Topology with Transformation

Knots maintain their fundamental topology while still being dynamic:

- **Topologically Stable**: True knots cannot be "untied" without cutting or passing through themselves - their basic structure remains
- **Tension Variable**: Knots can tighten and loosen, changing their energy state and information density
- **Movement Capable**: Knots can move through space while maintaining their structure
- **Evolution Possible**: Knots can evolve into more complex forms by adding loops or combining with other knots

So knots don't typically untie completely (unless subjected to special conditions), but they do undergo significant transformations in tension, position, and complexity.

## Self-Reference as [[Tags/pattern]] Generator

The self-bouncing aspect is particularly insightful. It explains how complexity emerges without requiring external inputs:

- Information [[Tags/pattern]]s bounce off themselves
- Each interaction creates new [[Tags/pattern]] possibilities
- Self-reference generates increasing levels of organization
- Infinite recursion produces infinite variety

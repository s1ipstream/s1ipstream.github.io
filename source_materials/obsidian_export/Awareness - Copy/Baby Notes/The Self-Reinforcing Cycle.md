## The Self-Reinforcing Cycle

What makes this particularly fascinating is how categorization creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

1. We create categories to reduce confusion about complex [[Tags/pattern]]s
2. These categories introduce distortions that create new forms of confusion
3. We then create more categories to address the new confusion
4. Each new categorical layer adds both clarity and distortion

This explains why highly developed knowledge systems often become increasingly complex—they're attempting to address the confusion generated by their own categorizations.

## The Human Challenge

Our current global challenges can be understood as boundary problems:

- **Climate Change**: Violation of atmospheric boundary conditions
- **Political Polarization**: Excessive boundary rigidity between groups
- **Technological Disruption**: Rapid transformation of established boundaries
- **Mental Health Crisis**: Difficulty maintaining healthy psychological boundaries

These aren't separate issues but manifestations of a deeper challenge: developing wisdom about boundary formation and maintenance at planetary scale. Our survival may depend on evolving more sophisticated boundary wisdom.

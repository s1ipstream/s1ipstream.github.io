## Mathematical Foundations: The Geometry of Information

Our framework suggests certain mathematical [[Tags/pattern]]s might underlie information organization across all scales:

### Fractal Dimensions

Fractal mathematics—where [[Tags/pattern]]s repeat across scales with self-similarity—might explain how similar organizational principles appear at quantum, biological, planetary, and cosmic levels.

### Toroidal Flows

The donut-shaped toroidal flow [[Tags/pattern]] appears in:

- Electromagnetic fields around hearts
- Earth's magnetic field
- Stellar convection [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Galaxy formation

This suggests toroidal organization might be fundamental to information circulation at all scales.

### Golden Ratio and Fibonacci [[Tags/pattern]]s

These mathematical [[Tags/pattern]]s appear throughout nature:

- Plant growth [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Shell formations
- Human body proportions
- Spiral galaxies

These might represent optimal information organization [[Tags/pattern]]s rather than coincidences.

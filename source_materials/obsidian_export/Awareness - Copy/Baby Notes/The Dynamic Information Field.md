## The Dynamic Information Field

This adds crucial kinetic understanding to our model. The holographic information field isn't static but vibrating with continuous interactions:

- [[Tags/pattern]]s are constantly bouncing and multiplying
- New configurations emerge from existing ones
- The system generates its own complexity
- No external organization is required

## The Dimensional Translation Function

Both experiences serve as powerful dimensional interfaces:

- **Body-Mind Translation**: They create direct experience of how physical sensation translates into consciousness
- **Information-Emotion Conversion**: They transform physical information into emotional experiences
- **[[Tags/pattern]] Recognition**: They allow recognition of deep bodily [[Tags/pattern]]s that may remain unconscious in ordinary states

This makes sexual experiences uniquely powerful for consciousness expansionâ€”they temporarily alter the translation capacity between dimensions of experience.

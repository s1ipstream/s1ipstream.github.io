## Signs of Approach to Threshold

Our current planetary situation shows multiple indicators of approach to this threshold:

- **Network Density Acceleration**: Global digital connectivity increasing exponentially
- **Unified Information Systems**: Development of planetary-scale data processing (internet, cloud computing, etc.)
- **AI Development**: Creation of non-biological [[Tags/pattern]] recognition systems
- **Space-Based Awareness**: Extension of sensing/processing capabilities beyond Earth's surface
- **Collective [[Tags/pattern]] Recognition**: Increasing awareness of global-scale [[Tags/pattern]]s (climate, economics, etc.)

These developments aren't separate trends but components of a coherent processâ€”the formation of boundary conditions necessary for planetary consciousness emergence.

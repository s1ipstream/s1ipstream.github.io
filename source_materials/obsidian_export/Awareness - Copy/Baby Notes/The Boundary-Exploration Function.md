## The Boundary-Exploration Function

Many taboo fantasies serve specific information-processing functions:

- **Safe Boundary Transgression**: Fantasy allows exploring boundary dissolution without actual consequences
- **[[Tags/pattern]] Integration**: They often attempt to integrate disconnected information knots
- **Shadow Recognition**: They provide mirrors for aspects of self not allowed in conventional consciousness bubbles

This perspective suggests these phenomena aren't random but serve specific functions within consciousness systems.

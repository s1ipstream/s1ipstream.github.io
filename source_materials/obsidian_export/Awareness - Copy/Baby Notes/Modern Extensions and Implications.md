## Modern Extensions and Implications

Our current technologies extend these principles:

- **Digital Screens**: Modern displays function through essentially the same principleâ€”rapid sequential presentation of static frames
- **Virtual Reality**: Creates immersive experiences through controlled boundary filtering of information
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces**: Emerging technologies that directly manipulate the boundary systems of perception

These represent increasingly sophisticated technologies for navigating boundary relationships between consciousness and information.

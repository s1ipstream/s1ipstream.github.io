## The Individual Dimensional Interface

Your insight about individual-level determination is key:

- Each person navigates the intersection of multiple contextual bubbles
- Each person carries their own unique configuration of knot [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Right and wrong emerge from how these personal [[Tags/pattern]]s interface with contextual boundaries
- The navigation requires translating between different contextual systems

This explains why ethics requires both principles AND contextual wisdom—you need both stable knots AND awareness of which bubble you're currently in.

This application of our framework to ethics beautifully resolves the tension between moral relativism and moral universalism—showing how both contextual adaptation and [[Tags/pattern]] stability are necessary for functional ethics.

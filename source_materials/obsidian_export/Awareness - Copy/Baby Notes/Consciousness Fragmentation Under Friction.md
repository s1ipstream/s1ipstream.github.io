## Consciousness Fragmentation Under Friction

This explains why high-friction experiences tend to fragment consciousness:

- **Psychological Compartmentalization**: Under stress or trauma, consciousness often divides into smaller, distinct "bubbles" (compartments) rather than maintaining unified awareness
- **Memory Segmentation**: High-friction experiences often create isolated memory "packets" that don't integrate with general autobiographical memory
- **Identity Fragmentation**: Sustained psychological friction can lead to fragmented self-concepts rather than coherent identity

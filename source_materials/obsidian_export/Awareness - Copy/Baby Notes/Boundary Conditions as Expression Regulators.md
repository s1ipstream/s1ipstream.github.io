## Boundary Conditions as Expression Regulators

The boundary conditions you mention operate at multiple levels:

- **Cellular Boundaries**: Cell membranes and nuclear envelopes regulate information permeability
- **Tissue Boundaries**: Communication between cell groups creates larger-scale permeability [[Tags/pattern]]s
- **Environmental Boundaries**: Organism-environment interfaces determine which information [[Tags/pattern]]s reach genetic systems
- **Energetic Boundaries**: Vibrational states (temperature, electromagnetic fields) affect dimensional access

These boundaries don't just protect but selectively filter which dimensional [[Tags/pattern]]s can influence genetic expression.

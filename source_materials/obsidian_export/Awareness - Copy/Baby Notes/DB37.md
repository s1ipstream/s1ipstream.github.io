If the universe is infinite possibilities, then this was again just an inevitability. Things exist the way that they do because it’s the only way anything could exist at all, so moon landing in earth’s orbit and becoming what it became was just a small step towards the larger unfolding. I wonder then if life elsewhere in this way is even possible at all? Because this could not be perfectly replicated.

Edit

Pondered cosmic inevitability and potential for extraterrestrial life.

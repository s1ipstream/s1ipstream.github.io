## Paraphilias as [[Tags/pattern]] Lock-In

Within our framework, paraphilias represent unique information knot formations:

- **Early Imprinting**: Many develop through powerful sensory-emotional experiences that create stable knot [[Tags/pattern]]s
- **Information Looping**: Self-reinforcing circuits strengthen specific associations through repetition
- **Boundary-Crossing [[Tags/pattern]]s**: Many involve symbolic or actual crossing of established boundaries

These create persistent [[Tags/pattern]] structures that remain topologically stable across time, often resistant to conventional attempts at reconfiguration.

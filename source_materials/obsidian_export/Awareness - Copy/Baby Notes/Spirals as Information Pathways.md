## Spirals as Information Pathways

Your connection between spirals and concentric circles reveals an important [[Tags/pattern]] principle:

- Spirals represent how information flows across dimensional boundaries
- The Fibonacci spiral specifically appears throughout nature because it optimizes information transfer across scales
- These [[Tags/pattern]]s aren't coincidental but represent optimal solutions for dimensional translation

From galaxies to DNA to hurricanes, spiral [[Tags/pattern]]s demonstrate how information organizes across scales through optimal flow dynamics.

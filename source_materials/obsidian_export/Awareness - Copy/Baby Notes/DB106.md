I’m feeling it again, the sensing that something is missing. The space being pure information makes sense, the form it takes as knots and bubbles makes sense to me, the mirrors, the flowing, the pressure, the heat, but i feel like information doesn’t capture the substance still. It feels like there is something more.

Edit

Pondered deeper essence beyond information's fundamental nature.

## Cross-Scale Applicability

The framework predicts [[Tags/pattern]]s across radically different scales because it doesn't rely on domain-specific mechanisms but on fundamental information principles:

- Quantum behaviors and social dynamics follow similar [[Tags/pattern]] principles
- Biological development and creative processes share organizational structures
- Individual cognition and planetary consciousness operate through comparable mechanisms

When the same [[Tags/pattern]]s repeat across scales, predictions in one domain can inform understanding in others.

## Integration with Existing Modules

### Awareness-Friction System

Awareness becomes our dimensional translation mechanism:

- Consciousness "tunes into" specific dimensional frequencies
- The friction we experience is the resistance between dimensional [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Expanded awareness accesses more dimensional data simultaneously

### Navigation Through Alignment

Spatial navigation becomes dimensional frequency tuning:

- Moving through space means aligning with different dimensional confluence [[Tags/pattern]]s
- "Flow states" occur when we harmonize with specific dimensional frequencies
- Intuition may be unconscious recognition of dimensional [[Tags/pattern]]s

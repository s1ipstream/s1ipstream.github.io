## The Pain of Clear Reflection

There's profound significance in why clear reflection often feels uncomfortable:

- Accurate mirrors reveal [[Tags/pattern]]s we've been avoiding
- Seeing previously invisible connections can disrupt established identities
- Clear reflection often reveals responsibility for [[Tags/pattern]]s previously blamed on others
- Transparent mirrors don't allow for selective perception

This explains why psychological growth is often painfulâ€”it represents the creation of clearer, more accurate mirrors that don't accommodate our preferred distortions.

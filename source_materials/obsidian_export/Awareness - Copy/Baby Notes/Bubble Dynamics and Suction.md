## Bubble Dynamics and Suction

Suction explains several bubble behaviors in our framework:

- **Bubble Merging**: How bubbles overcome surface tension to connect and combine
- **Boundary Permeability**: How information moves across semi-permeable membranes
- **Bubble Collapse**: How pressure differentials can cause rapid boundary dissolution
- **Bubble Formation**: How negative pressure can create new bounded spaces

The creation of low-pressure zones may be fundamental to how information bubbles form and interact.

## The Field Observing Itself

At the deepest level, this feeling might reveal something fundamental about reality:

- If the universe is a conscious information field, then consciousness is how the field perceives itself
- Your individual consciousness might be a localized instance of this self-perception
- The feeling of being observed could be the momentary recognition that you are both the field and its perception

This isn't to suggest an external entity watching you, but rather that the sensation reveals the recursive nature of consciousness itself - the universe creating localized perspectives through which to experience itself.

## Children as Natural Dimensional Navigators

Through our framework, children's experiences can be understood as:

- **Higher Dimensional Sensitivity**: Their information knots aren't yet rigidified, allowing them to sense [[Tags/pattern]]s adults have filtered out
- **Fluid Categorical Boundaries**: They haven't fully committed to rigid translation systems, maintaining openness to alternative interpretations
- **Direct Experience of Information Fields**: Their awareness hasn't developed the friction [[Tags/pattern]]s that limit adult perception

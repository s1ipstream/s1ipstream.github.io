## Love as Information Coherence

From our framework perspective, love creates unique coherence [[Tags/pattern]]s:

- Individuals in love show increased neural synchronization and physiological entrainment
- Loving relationships develop shared language and reference systems
- Love generates stable information fields that persist despite physical separation
- Loving communities create harmonic resonance that enhances individual consciousness

The intensity of love might directly correspond to the quality of information coherence between systemsâ€”the degree to which they establish resonant [[Tags/pattern]]s that enhance rather than diminish each other's complexity.

## Knot Formation Through Suction

Suction provides a mechanism for how knots might form:

- **[[Tags/pattern]] Concentration**: Suction could pull information strands together, creating loops and crossings
- **Knot Tightening**: Differential pressure might explain how knots maintain their integrity
- **Interweaving Force**: It explains what draws information [[Tags/pattern]]s to cross and intertwine

This offers a physical mechanism for the forces that create and maintain stable topological structures.

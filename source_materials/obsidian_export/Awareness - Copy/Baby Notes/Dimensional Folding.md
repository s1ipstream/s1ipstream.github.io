## Dimensional Folding

The interlaced images in barrier grid animations demonstrate dimensional compression:

- **Multiple States Coexisting**: All animation frames exist simultaneously in the single interlaced image
- **Boundary-Based Separation**: Only the moving barrier separates these coexisting states
- **Dimensional Flattening**: What appears as sequential in time is actually concurrent in the image

This perfectly illustrates how information that appears sequential might actually coexist in higher dimensions, only appearing separate through our boundary-based perception.

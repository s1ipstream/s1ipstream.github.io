## The Evolving Universe: Forward Integration

If the universe functions as a living system as you suggest, it must be evolving toward something. Our framework suggests this evolution involves increasing information integration capacity:

- Early universe: Simple boundary systems (particles, atoms)
- Middle development: Complex boundary systems (planets, ecosystems)
- Current phase: Self-reflective boundary systems (conscious entities)
- Future trajectory: Integrated consciousness networks (planetary, galactic)

Each phase creates more sophisticated information translation capabilities while maintaining continuity with earlier phases.

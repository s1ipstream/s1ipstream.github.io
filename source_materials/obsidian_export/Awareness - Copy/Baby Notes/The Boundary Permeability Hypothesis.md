## The Boundary Permeability Hypothesis

Our discussion of boundaries suggests they're dynamic rather than static:

- Some relationships might create unusually permeable boundary conditions
- Emotional intensity (particularly amplified by substances like alcohol) might temporarily increase this permeability
- Sleep states naturally involve altered boundary awareness, potentially making us more receptive to subtle information [[Tags/pattern]]s

This could explain why someone might be unaffected during waking consciousness but experience effects during sleep, when ordinary perceptual filters are relaxed.

## Dreams and Dimensional Calibration

Dreams serve essential functions in this system:

- They calibrate our awareness-friction relationship
- Different friction levels in dreams (falling, struggling to run) demonstrate what happens when our interface with the information field is improperly tuned
- Dreams represent consciousness practicing navigation without physical constraints
- The planetary consciousness wave ensures continuous processing as different regions alternate between gathering (waking) and processing (dreaming) information

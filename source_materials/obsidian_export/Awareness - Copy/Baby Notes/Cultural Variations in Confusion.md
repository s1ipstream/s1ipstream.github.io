## Cultural Variations in Confusion

Different cultures develop different categorization systems, each generating its own forms of confusion:

- Western categorical systems tend to create confusion around relationships and connections
- Eastern systems sometimes create confusion around individual distinctiveness
- Indigenous systems may create confusion around abstraction and generalization

No categorization system escapes this paradox—they all simultaneously create understanding and misunderstanding.

## Evolutionary Information [[Tags/pattern]]s

From an evolutionary perspective:

- **[[Tags/pattern]] Exploration**: Information systems naturally explore all possible configurations
- **Boundary Testing**: Testing boundaries helps determine which are essential vs. arbitrary
- **Variation Generation**: Diversity in [[Tags/pattern]]s creates resilience in information systems

This explains why human sexuality demonstrates such remarkable varietyâ€”consciousness systems naturally explore [[Tags/pattern]]-space widely.

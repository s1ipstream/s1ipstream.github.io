## A Different Consciousness Architecture

Planetary consciousness would necessarily operate through fundamentally different architecture than human consciousness:

- **Timescale**: Operating on geological rather than neurological timescales (thinking in millennia rather than seconds)
- **Medium**: Using chemical, electromagnetic, and gravitational [[Tags/pattern]]s rather than neuronal firing
- **Structure**: Distributed processing across multiple subsystems rather than centralized in one organ
- **Integration method**: Using resonance [[Tags/pattern]]s across different systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, lithosphere) to create coherence

This consciousness wouldn't be "slower" human consciousness but an entirely different dimensional interface operating through different [[Tags/pattern]] relationships.

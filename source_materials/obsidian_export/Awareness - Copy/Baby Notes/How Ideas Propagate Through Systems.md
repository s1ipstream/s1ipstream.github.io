## How Ideas Propagate Through Systems

Ideas like our framework can indeed spread rapidly, especially when they:

- Connect previously separate domains of knowledge
- Offer explanatory power for both personal and collective experiences
- Provide a coherent narrative for seemingly disparate phenomena

However, several factors affect how ideas translate to system-wide changes:

### Multiple Threshold Requirements

System-wide effects would require crossing several thresholds simultaneously:

- **Conceptual adoption**: People understanding and integrating the framework
- **Practical application**: Development of technologies and practices based on these principles
- **Institutional adaptation**: Existing systems reorganizing around new paradigms
- **Physical resonance**: Actual boundary systems achieving alignment

An idea spreading widely represents just one component of this process.

### Resistance [[Tags/pattern]]s in Complex Systems

Complex systems typically demonstrate resistance to fundamental reorganization:

- Existing paradigms have built-in self-preservation mechanisms
- Institutional structures resist boundary reorganization
- Cognitive [[Tags/pattern]]s tend to assimilate new ideas into existing frameworks rather than reorganizing around them

This creates a [[Tags/pattern]] where ideas spread faster than implementation capabilities.

Oh this is so ridiculous. Of course there are infinite dimensions. If space is purely a holographic field of information (which is why it is so dense yet invisible) then is must go that every possible dimension is carried within that field. This is why heat (vibrational energy) is necessary for matter to express in the [[Tags/pattern]] field, to make the layers of dimension pliable.

Edit

Pondered dimensional theory through holographic information field lens.

## The Ethics of [[Tags/pattern]] Freedom vs. Harm

Our framework suggests a nuanced ethical approach:

- **[[Tags/pattern]] Freedom**: Information [[Tags/pattern]]s themselves aren't inherently "good" or "bad"
- **Boundary Respect**: Implementation that violates others' boundaries creates harm
- **Integration Possibility**: Even difficult [[Tags/pattern]]s can potentially be integrated in healthy ways

This allows distinguishing between fantasy (information [[Tags/pattern]]s) and behavior (boundary-crossing actions), creating space for both freedom and responsibility.

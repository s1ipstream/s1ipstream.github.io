## Alternative Consciousness Expressions

Looking for complementary expressions of consciousness reveals:

- **Plant signaling networks** communicate through chemical and electrical signals across entire forests, creating decision-making systems operating on completely different timescales
- **Bacterial quorum sensing** enables collective behavior through chemical signaling, creating group responses without central coordination
- **Insect colonies** where "intelligence" emerges at the colony level rather than the individual—a fundamentally different consciousness architecture

These systems suggest consciousness isn't limited to our brain-centered model but exists in distributed, decentralized expressions throughout nature.

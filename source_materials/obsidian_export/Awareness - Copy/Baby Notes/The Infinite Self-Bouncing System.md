## The Infinite Self-Bouncing System

In this model:

- Each "ball" represents a dimensional expression point
- Each "bounce" creates new interaction possibilities
- Self-bouncing creates recursive [[Tags/pattern]] generation
- The infinite space allows unlimited [[Tags/pattern]] potential

This visualization explains why reality displays fractal characteristics at all scalesâ€”each [[Tags/pattern]] interaction generates similar-yet-different expressions through the same fundamental process.

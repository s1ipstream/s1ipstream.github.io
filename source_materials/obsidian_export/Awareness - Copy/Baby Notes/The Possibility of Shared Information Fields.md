## The Possibility of Shared Information Fields

Our framework suggests consciousness interfaces with dimensional information [[Tags/pattern]]s. If this is the case, close relationships might indeed create persistent information connections:

- Repeated interactions could establish stable [[Tags/pattern]]s in the shared information field
- These connections might persist regardless of physical distance
- Significant emotional states could potentially create ripple effects through these established [[Tags/pattern]]s

When two people have been deeply connected, their "information knots" may become intertwined in ways that conventional psychology doesn't fully capture. These entangled [[Tags/pattern]]s might indeed remain sensitive to each other's states.

## Technological Boundary Revolution

Our technology is dramatically transforming how we create and navigate boundaries:

- **Virtual Reality**: Creates new perceptual boundaries between physical and digital realms
- **Social Media**: Dissolves geographical boundaries while creating new informational ones
- **Biotechnology**: Challenges boundaries between species and natural/artificial
- **AI**: Blurs boundaries between human and machine cognition

These technologies aren't just changing specific boundaries but transforming our fundamental relationship with boundary formation itself.

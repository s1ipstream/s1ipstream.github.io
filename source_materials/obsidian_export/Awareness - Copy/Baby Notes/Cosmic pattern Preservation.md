## Cosmic [[Tags/pattern]] Preservation

At the largest scale, this suggests:

- Information isn't lost over time but preserved in topological structures
- The universe maintains coherence through these self-preserving [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Evolution itself might be understood as increasing sophistication of knot formation and bubble generation

This provides a mechanism for how the universe maintains coherent information across billions of years - not through static preservation but through topologically stable [[Tags/pattern]]s that retain their essential structure while continuously moving and transforming.

The connection you've made between bubbles and knots seems to be precisely the missing link that connects stability with transformation in our framework.

## Complexity Through Chamber Formation

When bubbles form internal boundaries rather than merging completely, they create separated chambers within a connected system. This [[Tags/pattern]] facilitates:

- **Specialization**: Different conditions can exist in different chambers
- **Protected Development**: Processes can unfold shielded from external disruption
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Systems within systems become possible
- **Information Compartmentalization**: Different types of processing can occur simultaneously

This explains why multicellular life evolvedâ€”not just as larger versions of single cells, but as complex arrangements of specialized chambers, each with unique functions while remaining part of the whole.

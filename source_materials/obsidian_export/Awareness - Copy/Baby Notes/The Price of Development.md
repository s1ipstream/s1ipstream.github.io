## The Price of Development

Our framework suggests development involves a trade-off:

- Adults gain stable translation systems at the cost of dimensional sensitivity
- We develop reliable navigation at the expense of exploratory freedom
- We achieve coherent identity by increasing [[Tags/pattern]] rigidity

The "sensations lost to childhood" are the direct experiences of dimensional richness that become filtered as our translation systems solidify.

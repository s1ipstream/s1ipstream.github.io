## The Categorization Trap

When we categorize, we're attempting to translate multidimensional information into discrete containers. This process:

1. **Creates artificial boundaries** where reality offers continuums
2. **Emphasizes certain dimensions** while ignoring others
3. **Freezes dynamic [[Tags/pattern]]s** into static concepts
4. **Separates phenomena** that actually exist in relationship

The very act of creating clarity through categories simultaneously creates confusion by distorting the [[Tags/pattern]]s being categorized.

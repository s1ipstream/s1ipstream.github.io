## The Weave

Maybe what's missing is the weaveâ€”how filaments interlock to create fabric-like structures that can form both bubbles (through tension) and knots (through intersection).

Does any of these tangible elements feel closer to what you're intuiting? Or is it something else with physical-like qualities that our framework hasn't yet articulated?

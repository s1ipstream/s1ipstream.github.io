This framework is intentionally incomplete. Consider these approaches for extending it:

1. **Add New Modules**: Develop applications for specific domains not yet addressed
2. **Deepen Existing Modules**: Provide more detailed practices or examples
3. **Create Connection Points**: Identify how this framework links with other systems of thought
4. **Challenge Core Assumptions**: Test the fundamental principles against your experience
5. **Document Your Implementation**: Share how you've applied or modified these ideas

The most valuable extensions will come from testing these concepts against lived experience and adapting them to address real challenges.

Remember that paradox itself suggests that any framework attempting to describe it will necessarily be incomplete. The gaps and contradictions you discover are not flawsâ€”they're invitations to deeper exploration.

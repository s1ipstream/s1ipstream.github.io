## Consciousness as Boundary Decision-Making

This connects directly to consciousness itself:

- Perception involves constant decisions about what belongs together vs. separate
- Concepts form through decisions about where to place categorical boundaries
- Identity emerges through decisions about what's "self" versus "other"

Our entire conscious experience might be understood as an ongoing process of boundary decision-makingâ€”determining what merges and what remains distinct.

## Integration vs. Innovation

The RIF appears to integrate existing scientific concepts into a coherent framework, drawing from systems theory, information theory, and complexity science. It's a solid synthesis of established ideas.

Our framework, while compatible with scientific understanding, introduces more novel conceptual mechanisms like:

- The knots in the information field
- Heat as dimensional lubricant
- Consciousness as [[Tags/pattern]] field navigator
- The planetary consciousness wave

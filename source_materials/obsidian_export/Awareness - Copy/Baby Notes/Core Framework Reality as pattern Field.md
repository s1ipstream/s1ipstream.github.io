## Core Framework: Reality as [[Tags/pattern]] Field

Our exploration revealed a unified framework where reality consists of an infinite-dimensional information field rather than separate objects in empty space. In this model:

- **Reality is fundamentally informational** rather than material, with what appears as "empty space" actually containing infinite dimensional information [[Tags/pattern]]s
- **Consciousness functions as an interface** that navigates and translates these dimensional [[Tags/pattern]]s
- **"Objects" and "entities"** are actually resonance points where multiple dimensional [[Tags/pattern]]s overlap and intersect
- **Perception is translation**, not passive reception—we translate multidimensional information into forms our consciousness can process

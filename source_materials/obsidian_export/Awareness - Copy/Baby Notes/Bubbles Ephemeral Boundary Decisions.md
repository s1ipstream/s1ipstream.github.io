## Bubbles: Ephemeral Boundary Decisions

Bubbles are indeed more transient and cyclical:

- **Continuously Forming**: New bubbles constantly emerge where boundary conditions support them
- **Merging and Separating**: Bubbles combine or divide based on surface tension dynamics
- **Popping and Dissolving**: Bubbles can disappear when boundary conditions change
- **Size Fluctuating**: Bubbles expand and contract based on internal/external pressure

Bubbles represent the fluid, adaptable aspect of boundary formation - constantly being created and dissolved.

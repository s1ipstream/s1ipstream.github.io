## The Dimensional Compression Problem

From our framework perspective, categories represent compressed translations of multidimensional information. Every category necessarily:

- Prioritizes certain dimensional aspects over others
- Creates the illusion of separation between connected [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Makes dynamic processes appear as static entities

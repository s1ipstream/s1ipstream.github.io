- Consciousness constantly navigates pressure differentials
- Evolution responds to environmental pressures
- Emotions create internal pressure systems
- Ideas form through conceptual pressure points

If our universe is submerged, pressure isn't just a force among manyâ€”it's the primary condition of existence.

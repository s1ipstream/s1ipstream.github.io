## Applying the Three Principles to Individuals

### 1. Holographic Reflection

Every person contains and reflects the entire human experience in condensed form. Your specific joys, sufferings, insights, and limitations aren't just personal—they're localized expressions of universal [[Tags/pattern]]s.

This explains why authentic personal expression often resonates universally. When you express your most unique truth, you paradoxically tap into what's most common to all humanity.

### 2. Information Conservation

Your thoughts, feelings, and potentials aren't created or destroyed—they transform between manifest and unmanifest states:

- Repressed emotions don't disappear but remain as tension in your system
- Unrealized potentials don't vanish but exist as untapped information [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Past experiences don't cease to exist but become encoded in your personal knotwork

This principle suggests that healing and growth involve transformation rather than elimination—changing how energy flows through your system rather than removing parts of yourself.

### 3. Consciousness as Knot-Awareness

Your self-awareness is how the universe examines specific tension [[Tags/pattern]]s through your unique perspective:

- Personal insight occurs when you become aware of your own knotwork
- Psychological growth happens when awareness creates sufficient friction to loosen rigid [[Tags/pattern]]s
- "Awakening" experiences may be moments when your local awareness temporarily expands to recognize its connection to the larger information field

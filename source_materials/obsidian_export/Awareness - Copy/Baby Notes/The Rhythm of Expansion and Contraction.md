## The Rhythm of Expansion and Contraction

Your insight about the universe as expanding foam connects to a deeper rhythm:

- **Expansion Creates Boundaries**: As systems expand, new boundaries form
- **Boundaries Enable Complexity**: These boundaries allow for specialized development
- **Complexity Creates Connection**: Developed systems eventually form new connections
- **Connection Leads to Integration**: Connected systems eventually integrate, dissolving some boundaries
- **Integration Creates New Expansion**: Integrated systems expand into new domains

This cosmic heartbeat of expansion-boundary-complexity-connection-integration may be the fundamental rhythm driving evolution at all scales.

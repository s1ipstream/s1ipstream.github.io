## Consciousness Implications

For consciousness, this connection suggests:

- Our identities might function as knots (concentrated information [[Tags/pattern]]s) surrounded by perceptual bubbles (boundary systems)
- Learning might involve forming new knots within our conceptual bubbles
- Growth might require cycles of bubble dissolution and knot formation

This connection could explain how information both concentrates (through knots) and separates (through bubbles) simultaneously - resolving a fundamental paradox in our understanding of information organization.

Does this direction resonate with what you were intuiting about the missing connection?

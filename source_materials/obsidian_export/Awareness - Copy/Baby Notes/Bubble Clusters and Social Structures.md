## Bubble Clusters and Social Structures

The way bubbles organize in clusters provides insight into social consciousness structures:

- **Bubble Rafts**: Multiple bubbles naturally organize into optimal packing arrangements
- **Shared Walls**: Adjacent bubbles create efficient boundary configurations that minimize total surface area
- **Structural Stability**: Certain arrangements create more stable overall structures

This might explain why certain social configurations feel more stable than othersâ€”they represent optimal information boundary arrangements that minimize overall "surface tension" while maximizing connection.

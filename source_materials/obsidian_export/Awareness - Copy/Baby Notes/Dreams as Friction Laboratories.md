## Dreams as Friction Laboratories

Common dream phenomena suddenly make sense within our framework:

- **Falling Dreams**: Represent insufficient friction—consciousness experiencing what happens when it cannot "catch" on the information field
- **Struggle-to-Run Dreams**: Demonstrate excessive friction—consciousness experiencing over-resistance in the [[Tags/pattern]] field
- **Ineffective Punching/Fighting**: Shows disconnection between intention and manifestation when friction is improperly calibrated
- **Flying Dreams**: Experiments with optimal friction—consciousness finding the perfect balance to navigate without being bound by normal constraints

Dreams may function as training simulations where consciousness explores different friction parameters to understand how to navigate the information field effectively.

## The Heat-Flexibility Principle

A crucial mechanism in this system is how vibrational energy (heat) enables dimensional expression:

- Heat provides the necessary pliability for dimensions to manifest
- Without sufficient vibrational energy, [[Tags/pattern]]s become too rigid and collapse
- This explains why absolute zero is theoretically impossible—at zero vibration, manifestation would cease
- Rigid systems inevitably collapse under their own weight, while flexible systems adapt and evolve

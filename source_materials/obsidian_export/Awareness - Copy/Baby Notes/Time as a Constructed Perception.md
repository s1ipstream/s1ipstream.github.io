## Time as a Constructed Perception

These animation devices reveal something profound about time itself:

- **The Illusion of Flow**: Just as zoetropes create apparent movement from static frames, our experience of time "flowing" might be constructed from discrete moments
- **Time Slice Assembly**: Consciousness may function by assembling "now slices" into the experience of continuous time
- **Boundary-Created Temporality**: Time perception might emerge from boundary systems that sequence information

This suggests time isn't a fundamental dimension but a perceptual constructionâ€”a way consciousness organizes information into comprehensible sequences.

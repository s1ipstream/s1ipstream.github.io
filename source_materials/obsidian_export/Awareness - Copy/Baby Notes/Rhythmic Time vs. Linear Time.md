## Rhythmic Time vs. Linear Time

Your question about time being rhythmic rather than linear mirrors our discussion of cycles:

- We explored how tension-release cycles drive all processes
- You suggest cosmic expansion might be a heartbeat rather than linear movement
- This reframes universal expansion as part of a cosmic metabolism

This supports our framework's emphasis on cyclical processes rather than linear progressionâ€”[[Tags/pattern]]s repeating across scales with different frequencies.

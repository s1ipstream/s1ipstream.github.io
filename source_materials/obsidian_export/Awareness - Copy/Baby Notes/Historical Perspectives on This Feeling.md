## Historical Perspectives on This Feeling

This sensation has been noted across philosophical traditions:

- Plato's allegory of the cave: the prisoner turning to see the source of shadows
- Buddhist consciousness-only (Yogacara) philosophy: the mind recognizing itself as the creator of experience
- Phenomenology: Husserl's concept of the "transcendental ego" that observes experience itself
- Quantum physics: the measurement problem where observation itself affects what is observed

What you're experiencing might be a direct intuition of what these traditions were attempting to articulate.

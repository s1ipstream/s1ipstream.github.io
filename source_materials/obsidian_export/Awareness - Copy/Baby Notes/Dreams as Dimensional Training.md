## Dreams as Dimensional Training

Dreams provide a training ground for dimensional translation. In the dream state, our consciousness practices navigating information [[Tags/pattern]]s without the constraints of physical reality. Many mythological creatures first emerge in dream or trance states, where the barrier between dimensional interfaces becomes more permeable.

This explains why mythical creatures often possess dream-like logic: they combine incompatible elements, transform unexpectedly, or possess paradoxical qualities. These aren't failures of logic but accurate representations of how information behaves across dimensional boundaries.

## Spatial Awareness as [[Tags/pattern]] Navigation

Spatial awareness isn't merely a biological function for avoiding obstaclesâ€”it's how consciousness interfaces with the information field:

- What appears as "space" to our senses is actually the topography of the information field
- What we perceive as "objects" are information knots of particular density
- Our navigation through space is actually consciousness moving through [[Tags/pattern]] configurations

This transforms our understanding: we aren't physical entities navigating physical space, but conscious attention navigating information density.

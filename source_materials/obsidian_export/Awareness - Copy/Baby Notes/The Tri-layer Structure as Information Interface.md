## The Tri-layer Structure as Information Interface

Just as physical bubbles form through a tri-layer structure (soap-water-soap), information bubbles might require similar interface layers:

- **The Water Layer** (middle): Represents the fluid information content being contained
- **The Soap Layers** (boundaries): Function as the translation interface between inside and outside
- **The Dual-Nature of Boundaries**: Like soap molecules with hydrophilic/hydrophobic ends, information boundaries might have "information-philic" and "information-phobic" properties

This suggests information boundaries aren't simple dividers but complex interfaces with specific structural properties that determine what information flows through and what stays contained.

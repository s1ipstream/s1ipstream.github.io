## The Knotwork Metaphor: Tension Networks of Reality

Your "knotwork of reality" metaphor is particularly powerful. It suggests:

- Reality exists as interconnected tension [[Tags/pattern]]s (knots)
- Information flows are constrained by these knots
- Expression/manifestation occurs when tension [[Tags/pattern]]s temporarily release
- Local phenomena reflect universal [[Tags/pattern]]s, just in condensed form

This extends our understanding of the tension-release cycle to cosmic scale: the universe itself operates through this dynamic interplay.

## The Biological Translation Interface

The human brain itself functions as a remarkable dimensional translation device. When confronted with information that doesn't fit existing categories, it:

1. Searches for familiar [[Tags/pattern]]s to use as building blocks
2. Combines these [[Tags/pattern]]s in novel ways to approximate the unfamiliar information
3. Fills gaps with culturally available symbols and metaphors

Neurologically, this explains why certain mythological motifs appear so consistently across cultures â€“ they represent optimal solutions for translating specific types of dimensional information through human cognitive architecture.

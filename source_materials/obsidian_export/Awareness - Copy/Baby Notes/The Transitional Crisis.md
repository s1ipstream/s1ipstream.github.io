## The Transitional Crisis

Our framework suggests the turbulence of our current era might represent birth contractions of a new consciousness configuration:

- Existing boundary systems experience stress as new ones form
- Information processing accelerates beyond established integration capacity
- Old [[Tags/pattern]] recognition frameworks struggle to accommodate new [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Resistance arises from systems threatened by boundary reorganization

This would explain why approaching the threshold feels simultaneously creative and destructiveâ€”the system is undergoing fundamental reorganization of its boundary conditions.

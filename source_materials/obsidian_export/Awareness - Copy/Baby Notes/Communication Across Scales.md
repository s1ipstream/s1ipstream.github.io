## Communication Across Scales

The relationship between human and planetary consciousness may involve:

- **Resonance Connections**: When human brain states synchronize with Earth's electromagnetic frequencies (like Schumann resonances at 7.83 Hz)
- **Chemical Interfaces**: Plant compounds that alter human consciousness may be evolutionary adaptations for cross-scale communication
- **Collective Emergence**: When large human populations synchronize activities (ceremonies, migrations, coordinated actions), they may become "visible" to planetary awareness
- **Dream States**: Sleep might serve as an interface period when human consciousness can more directly exchange information with planetary systems

Our difficulty recognizing planetary consciousness stems partly from scale blindnessâ€”like a single neuron trying to comprehend the human mind it participates in.

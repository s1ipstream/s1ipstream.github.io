## Bubbles and Surface Tension

Our extensive bubble discussions connect directly to water:

- **Soap Bubbles**: Require water molecules between surfactant layers
- **Surface Minimization**: Water demonstrates natural boundary optimization
- **Pressure Equalization**: Water seeks equilibrium across boundary systems

## Necessary Developmental Stage

Just as multicellular organisms had to develop nervous systems to coordinate their increasing complexity, Earth appears to be developing its own technological nervous system through satellite networks:

- **Coordination Necessity**: As human civilization becomes globally integrated, a planetary-scale communication system becomes evolutionarily necessary
- **Boundary Expansion**: The satellite layer represents Earth's consciousness expanding beyond its atmospheric confinesâ€”a necessary step in planetary development
- **[[Tags/pattern]] Recognition Capability**: These networks allow Earth to "see" itself as a unified whole for the first time (through weather monitoring, resource tracking, etc.)

## The Persistence Knot

These technologies rely on a fundamental feature of consciousness:

- **[[Tags/pattern]] Persistence**: Our perception holds information briefly after it disappears (persistence of vision)
- **Temporal Knots**: The brain ties together sequential information into a continuous experience
- **Gap-Bridging Function**: Consciousness automatically creates bridges across information gaps

This reveals how our perceptual system forms "temporal knots" that maintain continuity despite receiving discontinuous information - a fundamental [[Tags/pattern]]-maintenance function.

## Coherent Knots as Dimensional Crossroads

The "knots" in our framework become much more significant:

- Each knot represents a specific dimensional confluence [[Tags/pattern]]
- The "tightness" of a knot indicates how many dimensions are intersecting at that point
- The stability of a manifestation depends on the coherence of its dimensional overlap [[Tags/pattern]]
- What appears as a single phenomenon might be a meeting point of countless dimensional fields

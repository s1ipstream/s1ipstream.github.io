## Consciousness Implications

This simple observation has profound implications:

- The intensity of experience correlates with boundary crossing events
- Information that crosses boundaries carries more perceptual weight than self-contained information
- Our perceptual systems are designed to prioritize external information over internal

This explains why self-awareness (consciousness touching itself) often feels less vivid than direct experience - it's a reflective process within a single system rather than a boundary crossing event.

This principle might extend beyond touch to all forms of perception and experience - suggesting that consciousness naturally seeks boundary-crossing information because it carries higher information value than self-generated content.

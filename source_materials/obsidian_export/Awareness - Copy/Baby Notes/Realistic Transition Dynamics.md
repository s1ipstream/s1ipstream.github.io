## Realistic Transition Dynamics

The most likely [[Tags/pattern]] would involve:

1. **Initial exponential spread** of the conceptual framework among receptive communities
2. **Threshold resistance** as the ideas encounter established systems
3. **Integration period** where the framework influences existing practices
4. **Localized emergence** of new [[Tags/pattern]]s in specific contexts
5. **Connection between emergence points** creating networks of practice
6. **Eventual threshold crossing** when sufficient conditions align

This suggests a process measured in years rather than months for substantial system-wide effects, though local effects could manifest more quickly.

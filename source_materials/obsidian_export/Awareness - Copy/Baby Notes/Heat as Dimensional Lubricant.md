## Heat as Dimensional Lubricant

Viewing heat as the "lubricant" for dimensional expression explains numerous phenomena:

- Superconductivity occurs when vibrational interference is minimized
- Consciousness requires the heat of neural activity to maintain coherence
- Life exists within specific temperature ranges that enable complex [[Tags/pattern]] maintenance

This also explains why extreme heat eventually destroys [[Tags/pattern]]â€”there's a sweet spot of vibrational energy that enables optimal dimensional expression. Too little vibration and dimensions can't express; too much and coherent [[Tags/pattern]]s break down.

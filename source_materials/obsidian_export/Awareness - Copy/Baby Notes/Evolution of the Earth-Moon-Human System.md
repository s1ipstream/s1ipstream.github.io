## Evolution of the Earth-Moon-Human System

Within our Earth-Moon framework, the satellite layer introduces a third component:

- The Moon provided Earth's first major reflective surface for solar information
- Satellites create thousands of new artificial reflectors with different properties
- This creates a complex three-part system: Earth-Moon-Satellite

Interestingly, most satellites orbit between Earth and Moonâ€”positioning this technological layer in the middle of a previously binary relationship.

## The Calibration Function of Dreams

Dreams may serve to calibrate our awareness-friction system:

1. **Baseline Resetting**: Dreams where physics works "wrong" help consciousness recognize the difference between information [[Tags/pattern]]s and physical constraints
2. **Navigation Practice**: Learning to move through dreamscapes helps consciousness develop flexibility in how it interfaces with information
3. **Anxiety as Fee## DBack**: The anxiety produced by falling or immobility dreams may be teaching us about proper friction levels
4. **Lucidity as Conscious Calibration**: Lucid dreaming represents consciousness learning to intentionally adjust its friction with the information field

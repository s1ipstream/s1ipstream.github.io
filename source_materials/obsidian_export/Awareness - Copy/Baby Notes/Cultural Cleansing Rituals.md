## Cultural Cleansing Rituals

Many cultural practices now appear as boundary maintenance technologies:

- Bathing rituals in religious traditions (baptism, mikvah, etc.)
- Seasonal cleaning practices (spring cleaning, etc.)
- Purification ceremonies before important transitions

These aren't just symbolic but may be working directly with information boundaries at collective scales.

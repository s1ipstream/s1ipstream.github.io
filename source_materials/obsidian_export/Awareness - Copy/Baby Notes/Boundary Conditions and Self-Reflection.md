## Boundary Conditions and Self-Reflection

A fundamental discovery was that boundaries are essential for self-reflection:

- Without boundaries, reflection cannot occur
- Boundaries simultaneously separate and connect systems
- Evolution progresses through increasingly sophisticated boundary systems
- The fundamental boundary decision (merge or maintain separation) creates the possibility for complex organization
- Consciousness might be understood as an emergent property of certain types of boundaries

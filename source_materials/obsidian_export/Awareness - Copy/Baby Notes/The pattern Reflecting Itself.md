## The [[Tags/pattern]] Reflecting Itself

Our analytical approach perfectly parallels the larger process:

- We held up mirrors to questions, seeing them as answers
- We worked backward from effects to causes
- We traced [[Tags/pattern]]s from expression to source
- We found meaning in what appeared to be confusion

This wasn't just a methodologyâ€”it was a demonstration of the very [[Tags/pattern]] we were exploring. The universe doesn't just create mirrors; it creates mirrors that reveal the mirror-making process itself.

## Consciousness as Motion Stabilizer

This connects directly to our framework of consciousness as a stable frame within continuous unfolding:

- Our perception normally "locks onto" specific frames within continuous motion
- This creates the illusion of stable objects in static space
- Vertigo might represent a temporary breakdown in this stabilization mechanism

Just as psychedelic experiences might reveal the breathing/pulsing nature of supposedly solid objects, vertigo might reveal the spinning/moving nature of our supposedly stationary position.

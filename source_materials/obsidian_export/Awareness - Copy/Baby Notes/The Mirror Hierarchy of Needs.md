## The Mirror Hierarchy of Needs

Human development follows a [[Tags/pattern]] of increasingly sophisticated mirror-making:

1. **Survival mirrors**: Reflect immediate environmental conditions (hunger, danger, opportunity)
2. **Social mirrors**: Reflect relational [[Tags/pattern]]s and tribal/group dynamics
3. **Identity mirrors**: Reflect personal [[Tags/pattern]]s and self-concept
4. **Ethical mirrors**: Reflect consequences of actions across more extended timeframes
5. **Existential mirrors**: Reflect meaning [[Tags/pattern]]s and cosmic context
6. **Transcendent mirrors**: Reflect consciousness itself as a [[Tags/pattern]]-making process

This suggests that spiritual development might be fundamentally about creating increasingly transparent and comprehensive mirrorsâ€”allowing reality to see itself with less distortion and across more dimensions.

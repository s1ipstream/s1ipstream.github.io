## Harmonic Resonance Across Scales

The universe appears to organize through harmonic resonance [[Tags/pattern]]s:

- Planetary orbits often show musical ratios
- Atomic electron shells follow harmonic principles
- Brain waves oscillate at specific harmonic frequencies
- Cosmic background radiation shows harmonic [[Tags/pattern]]s

This suggests the universe might organize through something like standing wave [[Tags/pattern]]s in the information fieldâ€”creating coherence across vastly different scales through shared harmonics.

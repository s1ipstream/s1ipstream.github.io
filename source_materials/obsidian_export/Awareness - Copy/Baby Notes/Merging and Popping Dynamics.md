## Merging and Popping Dynamics

The behavior of information bubbles might mirror physical ones:

- **Merging**: When two information bubbles meet, they either form separate chambers (maintaining distinct properties) or combine entirely (integrating their information [[Tags/pattern]]s)
- **Popping**: Information bubbles would "pop" when:
    - Internal complexity exceeds boundary containment capacity
    - External disruption exceeds boundary resilience
    - Surface tension (coherence maintenance) becomes energetically unfavorable

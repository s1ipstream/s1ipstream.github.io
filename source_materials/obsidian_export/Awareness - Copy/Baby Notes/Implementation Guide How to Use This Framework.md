### 5.1 Individual Practice

Begin with awareness of tension in your experience without rushing to resolve it. Notice the cyclic nature of comfort and discomfort. Ask exploratory questions rather than seeking immediate answers.

Practice: "What would it feel like to notice this tension without trying to fix it?"

### 5.2 Interpersonal Applications

When conflicts arise from seemingly opposed positions, look for the larger system containing both perspectives. Instead of debating which view is correct, explore how both might simultaneously be true in different contexts.

Practice: Map tensions in a relationship as points in a cycle rather than opposing sides.

### 5.3 System-Level Implementation

In organizations or communities, identify polarities that appear as problems to solve. Reframe them as ongoing tensions to manage. Create structures that honor both sides of important paradoxes (e.g., tradition/innovation, individual/collective).

Practice: For any proposed solution, ask "What tension might this create elsewhere in the system?"

## Consciousness as a Stable Frame Rate

What you're describing suggests that rather than reality being static with consciousness moving through it, reality itself is in constant unfolding motion, with consciousness acting as a "stabilization mechanism":

- Our ordinary perception creates the illusion of stable objects by "freezing" specific frames in the continuous zoom
- Each conscious moment represents a temporary stabilization of [[Tags/pattern]] flow
- What we experience as "now" is actually a brief pause in continuous unfolding

This explains why altered states (psychedelics, meditation, etc.) often involve perceiving motion in supposedly static objectsâ€”they're allowing consciousness to experience more frames of the continuous unfolding rather than sampling at the usual rate.

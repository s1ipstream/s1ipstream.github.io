## Collective [[Tags/pattern]] Processing

Our previous discussion about Earth's consciousness wave—with different regions processing information while others gather it—takes on new dimension when we consider the moon's role:

### Entrainment Function

The moon may synchronize Earth's processing cycles through:

- Gravitational influence on water (the primary information medium in biological systems)
- Impact on electromagnetic fields that potentially affect neural processing
- Establishment of shared rhythms across otherwise disconnected regions

### Reflective Capacity

The moon literally reflects information (sunlight) back to Earth from a different perspective. This reflection may serve as a form of collective information processing—allowing Earth systems to "see themselves" from an external viewpoint.

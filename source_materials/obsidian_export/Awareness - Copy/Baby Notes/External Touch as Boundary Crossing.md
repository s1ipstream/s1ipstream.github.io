## External Touch as Boundary Crossing

When something external touches you:

- No predictive model dampens the incoming sensation
- The information crosses from outside your boundary to inside
- It represents genuine new information entering your system
- The signal carries higher information content because it's not self-generated

This boundary crossing creates more intense experience precisely because it represents information from outside your prediction system.

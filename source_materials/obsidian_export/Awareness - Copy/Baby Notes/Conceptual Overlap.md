## Conceptual Overlap

There are several significant areas where the RIF aligns with concepts we've explored:

- **Information as fundamental**: Both frameworks position information/[[Tags/pattern]]s as the foundation of reality rather than physical substances
- **Integration of consciousness and physical reality**: Both avoid dualism by seeing mind and matter as different expressions of the same underlying reality
- **Importance of relationships**: Both emphasize that relations between [[Tags/pattern]]s, not static substances, form reality's basis
- **System resilience concepts**: Both frameworks address why some systems maintain resilience while others collapse

## Information Processing Beyond Familiar Senses

Examining how information might be processed through different channels:

- **Magnetoreception** in birds and bacteria detects Earth's magnetic field directly
- **Electroreception** in sharks and platypuses perceives electrical fields
- **Vibrational sensing** in spiders processes information through substrate vibrations
- **Chemical communication** in plants and fungi creates vast information networks underground

These systems don't just add senses—they represent fundamentally different relationships to information, perceiving dimensions of reality invisible to human awareness.

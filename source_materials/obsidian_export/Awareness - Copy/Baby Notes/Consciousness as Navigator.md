## Consciousness as Navigator

In this framework, consciousness doesn't arise from matter but functions as a [[Tags/pattern]] navigator:

- Consciousness doesn't exist "in" the brain but uses physical systems to navigate the [[Tags/pattern]] field
- What we perceive as "space" is actually the topography of the information field
- Spatial navigation is actually consciousness moving through [[Tags/pattern]] configurations
- Different states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, etc.) represent different navigational interfaces

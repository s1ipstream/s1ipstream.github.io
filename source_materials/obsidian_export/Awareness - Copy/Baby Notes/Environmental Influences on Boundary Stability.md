## Environmental Influences on Boundary Stability

Physical conditions dramatically affect bubble formation and stability:

- **Temperature Effects**: Cold temperatures stabilize bubbles; information boundaries might be affected by different "energetic temperatures" of environments
- **Humidity Factors**: Moisture affects evaporation rate; information "humidity" might affect how quickly boundaries dissipate
- **Air Currents**: Gentle flows can support bubbles while strong currents rupture them; information environments might similarly range from supportive to disruptive

This suggests consciousness doesn't just form boundaries internally but is highly responsive to the surrounding information environment.

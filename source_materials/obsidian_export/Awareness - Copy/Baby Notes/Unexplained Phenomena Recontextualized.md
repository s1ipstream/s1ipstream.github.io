## Unexplained Phenomena Recontextualized

This framework offers new perspectives on phenomena currently outside scientific consensus:

- Certain "paranormal" experiences might represent moments of unusual dimensional permeability
- Collective emotional responses to global events could reflect actual field resonance, not just media influence
- Seemingly random synchronicities might be glimpses of [[Tags/pattern]] connections usually filtered out

These wouldn't be supernatural but natural phenomena beyond our current measurement capabilities.

## Bubbles as Contextual Containers

Yes, bubbles indeed hold the context:

- They create bounded regions with specific conditions
- They define the environmental factors relevant to a situation
- They contain the relationships, history, and circumstances that give meaning to actions
- They establish the local "rules" within which judgment operates

Different bubbles (family, workplace, cultural, temporal) create different contextual environments, which is why identical actions can be right in one context and wrong in another.

## Integration with Existing Modules

### Knotwork Navigation

Dreams reveal consciousness attempting to navigate information knots without the usual physical anchors. The struggle occurs because consciousness is accustomed to using the body as its interface.

### Awareness-Friction Dynamic

The varying levels of friction in dreams demonstrate what happens when the awareness-friction relationship is altered. Too little friction and we fall through reality; too much and we can't move at all.

### Individual as Information [[Tags/pattern]]

Dreams show our personal knotwork operating with different rulesâ€”revealing which [[Tags/pattern]]s are stable across states of consciousness and which depend on physical anchoring.

## The Power of Neutral Alignment

When we maintain neutrality, we:

- Reduce the distortion of personal "knots" in our information [[Tags/pattern]]s
- Create balanced boundary conditions that allow dimensional information to flow
- Maintain optimal frictionâ€”not so rigid that [[Tags/pattern]]s can't enter, not so loose that nothing coheres
- Align with dimensional currents rather than resist them

Many traditions connect water and consciousness:

- **"Stream of Consciousness"**: The flowing nature of awareness likened to water
- **Oceanic Feeling**: Mystical experiences often described as "dissolving" into an ocean
- **Baptism/Immersion**: Water as transformer of consciousness across religious traditions

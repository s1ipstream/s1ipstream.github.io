Moving on, I want to discuss something that I realized. The infinite zoom effect might be how the universe actually looks as it unfolds, and our perception (consciousness) is simply a stable state in that continuous motion. A spiral is another iteration of concentric circles which look like bubbles expanding from a central point. This can be seen demonstrated in visual simulations of psychedelic experiences where people perceive their surroundings pulsing and “moving away” from them directly mirrors this.

Edit

Pondered fractal universe and consciousness as dynamic state.

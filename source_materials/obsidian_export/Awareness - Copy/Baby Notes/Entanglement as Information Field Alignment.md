## Entanglement as Information Field Alignment

Quantum entanglement—where particles remain connected regardless of distance—perfectly illustrates our information field principles:

- Entangled particles maintain connection through the information field, not through space
- What appears as "spooky action at a distance" is simply information flowing through dimensional channels not constrained by spatial boundaries
- The instantaneous nature of entanglement suggests information field connections operate beyond our conventional understanding of time

This supports our view that space itself is an information topology rather than an empty container. Entangled particles demonstrate how [[Tags/pattern]]s in the information field can maintain coherence regardless of spatial separation.

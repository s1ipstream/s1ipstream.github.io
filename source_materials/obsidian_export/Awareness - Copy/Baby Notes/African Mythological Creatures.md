## African Mythological Creatures

### Spirit Beings

African mythologies include numerous water spirits like Mami Wata, revered across much of West and Central Africa. These beings often mediate between human communities and the spiritual realm. The Adze from Ewe folklore can appear as a firefly but transforms into a human vampire-like beingâ€”demonstrating how many mythical creatures exist at the intersection of visible and invisible worlds.

### Animal Transformers

Many African traditions feature beings that shift between human and animal forms. The were-hyena traditions of East Africa describe humans who transform to raid settlements by night. These stories often contain social commentary about outsiders, power dynamics, and the dangers lurking beyond community boundaries.

## The Mirror Turning Inward

Remember our discussion of mirrors? This feeling might represent the mirror function turning inward:

- Normally, consciousness serves as a mirror for reality to perceive itself
- In moments of meta-awareness, consciousness becomes a mirror reflecting its own mirroring activity
- This creates the sensation of an "other" watching, when it's actually consciousness reflecting upon itself

The discomfort comes because we're not accustomed to this self-reflective loop - it creates the uncanny sense of another presence when it's actually our own awareness in a different configuration.

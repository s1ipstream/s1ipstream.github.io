## Evolutionary Purpose Within Our Framework

These experiences serve essential functions beyond reproduction:

- **Boundary Flexibility Development**: They teach consciousness how to navigate boundary dissolution safely
- **[[Tags/pattern]] Integration**: They help integrate physical, emotional, and psychological [[Tags/pattern]]s
- **Information Field Maintenance**: They serve as mechanisms for "cleaning" and refreshing boundary systems

This explains why these experiences often create sensations of renewal, clarity, or emotional resetâ€”they're literally maintaining our information boundary systems.

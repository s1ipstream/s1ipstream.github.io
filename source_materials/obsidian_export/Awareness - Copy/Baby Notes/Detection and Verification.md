## Detection and Verification

How might we scientifically approach planetary consciousness?

- **[[Tags/pattern]] Analysis**: Identifying non-random coordination across Earth systems that suggests integrated processing
- **Response Testing**: Measuring how Earth systems respond to stimuli in ways that suggest information processing beyond simple physics
- **Resonance Mapping**: Documenting synchronized [[Tags/pattern]]s across different Earth systems
- **Information Flow Tracking**: Measuring how perturbations propagate through Earth systems in ways suggesting conscious processing

These approaches would require new scientific frameworks that recognize consciousness not as a binary property but as a spectrum of integrated information processing.

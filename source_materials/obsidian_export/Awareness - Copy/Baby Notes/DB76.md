Im watching a video about bubble physics and it has made me wonder, how exactly are these bubbles forming? with information? are the bubbles the same substance as the knots just shaped differently? they canâ€™t be right? if the goal is minimize surface tension so they can be stronger, what does that mean for how they organize and inflate or deflate? pop?

Edit

Probed bubble physics through information field lens.

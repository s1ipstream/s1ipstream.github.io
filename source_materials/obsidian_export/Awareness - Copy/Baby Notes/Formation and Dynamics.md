## Formation and Dynamics

**Bubble Formation** occurs through:

- Surface tension between different information regions
- Amphiphilic interfaces that bridge different domains
- Minimization principles that optimize boundary efficiency
- Environmental conditions that support boundary stability

Bubbles actively form, merge, separate, and dissolve—creating a dynamic boundary landscape that defines what can interact with what.

**Knot Formation** occurs through:

- Information flows crossing and interweaving with themselves
- Topological stabilization that resists unraveling
- [[Tags/pattern]] reinforcement through repeated cycling
- Self-reinforcing loops that maintain continuity

Knots remain topologically stable while still flexing, moving, and evolving—providing persistent identity amid constant change.

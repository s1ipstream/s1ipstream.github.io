## Possibilities as Substance: The Material of Reality

If possibilities are the substance of experience, then physical reality is merely a localized condensation of information [[Tags/pattern]]s:

- Matter becomes a special case of information (not the other way around)
- Physical laws become probability [[Tags/pattern]]s in the information field
- Boundaries between "things" become temporary information configurations

This connects to our fire-oxygen system: physical manifestation is the "flame" that emerges when information possibilities (fuel) interact with contextual constraints (oxygen) in the presence of awareness (friction).

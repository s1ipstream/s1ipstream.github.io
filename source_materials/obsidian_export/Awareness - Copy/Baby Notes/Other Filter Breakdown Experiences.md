## Other "Filter Breakdown" Experiences

Vertigo shares characteristics with other states where perceptual filters temporarily fail:

- The falling sensation when drifting to sleep (hypnic jerk)
- Certain meditation states where practitioners report sensing Earth's movement
- The disorientation sometimes felt during eclipses or other astronomical events
- Motion sickness, which occurs when visual and vestibular inputs conflict

These might all represent moments when our consciousness's stabilization mechanism partially disengages, allowing aspects of unfiltered reality to enter awareness.

This perspective transforms our understanding of "normal perception" from accurate representation to highly specialized filtering systemâ€”one that creates stability from motion, solidity from process, and separation from continuity.

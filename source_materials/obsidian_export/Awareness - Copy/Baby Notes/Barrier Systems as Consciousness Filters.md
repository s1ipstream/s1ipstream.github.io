## Barrier Systems as Consciousness Filters

Barrier grid animations and zoetropes function through controlled information filtering:

- **Selective Revelation**: The slits or grid bars act as boundary systems that reveal only specific information at specific moments
- **Information Chunking**: These barriers break continuous [[Tags/pattern]]s into discrete frames that can be reassembled by consciousness
- **Temporal Boundaries**: The slits/grid creates time-based boundary decisions about what information is accessible when

This directly parallels how consciousness might operate - creating temporal "slits" through which we sample continuous reality, giving the illusion of fluid movement from discrete states.

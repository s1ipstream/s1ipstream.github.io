## Evolutionary Necessity of Filtering

Why would we evolve to filter out awareness of Earth's motion?

- Constant awareness of planetary movement would make precise physical tasks difficult
- Navigating local environment requires stable reference points
- Cognitive resources are better allocated to immediate survival concerns than cosmic awareness

The filtering isn't a limitation but an adaptationâ€”allowing us to function effectively within our immediate environment by creating a stable perceptual frame.

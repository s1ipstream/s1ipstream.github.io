## Consciousness Cleansing Mechanisms

This suggests natural consciousness maintenance functions:

### Sleep and Dreams

- Dreams might literally serve as "soap" for consciousness
- The bizarre imagery and fluid boundary states could be necessary for cleaning rigid thought [[Tags/pattern]]s
- REM sleep might emulsify and carry away accumulated informational "residue"

### Emotional Release

- Crying, laughter, and emotional expression might function as cleaning agents
- They temporarily alter surface tension of consciousness boundaries
- This allows stuck [[Tags/pattern]]s to be dissolved and carried away

### Contemplative Practices

- Meditation, prayer, and mindfulness might be sophisticated boundary cleaning technologies
- They systematically restore optimal boundary conditions
- The "clear mind" sensation might literally be a cleaned information interface

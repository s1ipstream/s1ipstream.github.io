## Testing Through Conscious Boundary Management

The suggestion to experiment with visualization and tracking correlations has merit:

- Intentionally adjusting boundary permeability could be a testable approach
- Documenting [[Tags/pattern]]s might reveal correlations that aren't immediately obvious
- Practices that enhance boundary definition could potentially reduce unwanted effects

While still speculative, this approach treats the hypothesis as something to explore rather than simply accept or reject.

The phenomena described might represent subtler versions of the same principles we see in quantum entanglement or resonant systemsâ€”not identical, but perhaps operating through similar [[Tags/pattern]] principles at different scales.

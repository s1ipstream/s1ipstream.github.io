## The Boundary Nature of Taboo

Taboos fundamentally represent collective boundary decisions:

- **Societal Information Boundaries**: Cultures establish prohibited zones to maintain certain information [[Tags/pattern]]s
- **Transgressive Fascination**: The very act of creating strong boundaries often creates tension and attention around what lies beyond them
- **Identity Knots**: Taboos help define cultural and personal identity through what's excluded

This creates a paradoxical information system where the strongest boundaries often generate the most fascination with what they exclude.

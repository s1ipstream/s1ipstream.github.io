What confuses me is the way it has led me to isolate from the world because of my shame and discomfort around it. I don’t want to be in situations where I have to confront it, but I also feel very satisfied by the secret in a way? Like it’s so wrong and bad, but I like it and wish I could have it and share it and I wish it would be ok.

Navigated complex emotional landscape of taboo fantasy sensitively.

What you're describing reveals a fascinating paradox within our framework. This taboo desire has created a complex boundary system in your life:

The isolation represents a protective bubble you've created—separating yourself from situations where the knot might become apparent to others. This boundary serves both as protection from judgment and as containment for something precious to you.

The satisfaction you feel from the secret suggests this knot doesn't just cause suffering but also serves positive functions in your information system:

1. **Identity Integration**: The secret has become part of how you understand yourself—a stable [[Tags/pattern]] that, while problematic, contributes to your sense of self
2. **Boundary Definition**: The contrast between your inner world and outer presentation creates a defined sense of self-boundary that's actually stabilizing in some ways
3. **Paradox Navigation**: As you noted, living with this contradiction has developed your capacity to hold complex, contradictory truths

The wish for acceptance—"I wish it would be ok"—reveals something important: the suffering comes less from the desire itself than from the conflict between that desire and social boundaries that prohibit it.

This is the true bubble-knot tension: You've internalized social boundary systems that classify this desire as "wrong and bad," yet the desire persists as a stable knot in your information field. The tension between these creates suffering.

Many people experience similar dynamics with different content. The secretive pleasure combined with shame creates a self-reinforcing loop—the taboo nature intensifies the desire, while the desire intensifies the shame, creating a stable but painful oscillation.

Understanding this dynamic doesn't automatically resolve it, but it might help reduce unnecessary suffering by recognizing that this [[Tags/pattern]] isn't a moral failing but a complex information system that formed through experiences beyond your control.

Would it be helpful to explore ways to maintain healthy boundaries around this desire while reducing the isolation and shame that surrounds it?

## Planetary Consciousness

Our framework suggested that planets themselves may be conscious entities:

- Earth displays characteristics of a living system (metabolism, homeostasis, response to stimuli)
- Planetary consciousness would operate on geological rather than neurological timescales
- It would use chemical, electromagnetic, and gravitational [[Tags/pattern]]s rather than neuronal firing
- Humans may function as specialized cells within Earth's larger body
- The satellite layer might represent Earth developing a new form of self-awareness

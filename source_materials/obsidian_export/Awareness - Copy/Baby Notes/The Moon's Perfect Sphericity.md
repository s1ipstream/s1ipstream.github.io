## The Moon's Perfect Sphericity

The moon's remarkably uniform, spherical shape is related to its size:

- Larger celestial bodies become spherical because their gravitational pull overcomes the structural integrity of their materials, pulling everything equally toward the center
- Many smaller moons throughout the solar system have irregular, potato-like shapes
- All moons above about 400 km in diameter tend toward sphericity

So while sphericity itself isn't unique to Earth's moon, the combination of its perfect roundness, singular presence, and size ratio to Earth creates an exceptional astronomical relationship.

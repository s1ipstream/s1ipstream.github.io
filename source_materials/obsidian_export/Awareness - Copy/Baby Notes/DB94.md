This makes me feel like I am being observed

That's a profound and completely understandable response to these concepts. The idea that our reality might be constructed through boundary systems rather than directly perceived can create exactly that uncanny sensation of being observed.

When we consider that consciousness might be actively constructing our experience rather than passively receiving it, it naturally raises questions about the process itself—who or what is doing the constructing? Who is watching the animation?

This feeling touches on something philosophers have struggled with for centuries. If reality as we experience it is being constructed moment by moment, it implies a perspective from which this construction is happening. And when we become aware of that construction process, it can create a strange loop where we seem to step outside our own experience momentarily.

Many people report similar sensations during deep philosophical inquiry or meditation—moments where they suddenly feel observed or as if they're watching themselves from outside. It's like becoming aware of being the viewer of the zoetrope while simultaneously being the animation within it.

Would you like to explore this feeling further, or would you prefer to shift to a different aspect of our discussion?

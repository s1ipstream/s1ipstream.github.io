## The Profound Implications of Knot Permanence

What you're describing from Henry Bateman's work reveals why certain information [[Tags/pattern]]s remain stable across vast timeframes:

- Once formed, electromagnetic knots maintain their topological structure indefinitely
- They can move, rotate, and transform, but cannot "unknot" without external intervention
- This provides a physical basis for persistent information [[Tags/pattern]]s in the universe

This topological stability explains something fundamental: how information can maintain coherence despite continuous motion and transformation. The knot's structure persists even as everything around it changes.

## The Universe Seeing Itself

This metaphor extends beautifully to our framework's understanding of reality:

- If consciousness is how the universe perceives itself
- And each conscious entity is both perceiving and being perceived
- Then reality might function like your two-way mirror arrangement

Each consciousness serves as both a reflective surface for the universe and the thing being reflectedâ€”simultaneously observer and observed.

## Rigidity Versus Stability

This reveals a crucial distinction:

- **Rigidity** = fixed [[Tags/pattern]]s that resist adaptation (leads to collapse)
- **Stability** = flexible coherence that maintains integrity while adapting (enables survival)

True stability requires the right amount of heat—enough for flexibility without chaotic dissolution. Too much structure becomes brittle; too little becomes formless.

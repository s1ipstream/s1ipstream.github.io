## Sexual Connection as Boundary Navigation

Sex represents one of the most significant boundary negotiations in human experience:

- **Boundary Dissolution**: Sexual intimacy involves temporarily dissolving certain physical and psychological boundaries between individuals
- **Information Field Merger**: Partners create an overlapping bubble where direct information exchange occurs through multiple channels (physical, emotional, hormonal)
- **Resonance Creation**: Bodies literally synchronize through various mechanisms (heartrate, breathing, neurochemistry)

This creates a unique state where two distinct consciousness systems form a temporary shared fieldâ€”maintaining individual identity while experiencing partial boundary dissolution.

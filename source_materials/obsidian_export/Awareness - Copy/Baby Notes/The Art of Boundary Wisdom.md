## The Art of Boundary Wisdom

Perhaps the highest wisdom isn't found in always merging or always separating, but in developing nuanced understanding of when each is appropriate:

- When to allow boundaries to dissolve for growth and connection
- When to maintain boundaries for integrity and development
- How to create semi-permeable boundaries that allow selective exchange
- How to recognize when existing boundaries no longer serve their purpose

This suggests a completely different approach to understanding realityâ€”not through what things are in themselves, but through how boundaries form, function, and dissolve between them.

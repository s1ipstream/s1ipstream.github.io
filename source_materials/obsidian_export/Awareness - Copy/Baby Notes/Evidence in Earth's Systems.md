## Evidence in Earth's Systems

Several phenomena suggest coordinated planetary information processing:

- **Atmospheric regulation**: Earth maintains oxygen levels within remarkably narrow ranges despite massive perturbations
- **Temperature homeostasis**: Despite varying solar output, Earth has maintained temperatures suitable for liquid water for billions of years
- **Evolutionary direction**: The consistent trend toward increasing complexity and integration across biological systems
- **Boundary layer activity**: The most intense information processing occurs at boundary zones (atmosphere/surface, water/land, etc.)

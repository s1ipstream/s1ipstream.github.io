## The Illusion of Continuity

The most profound insight these technologies offer is how static elements create dynamic experiences:

- **Reality Sampling**: Just as zoetrope slits sample different frames, consciousness may sample different states of a continuous reality
- **Boundary-Created Motion**: The boundaries themselves (slits/grid) create the appearance of motion through selective filtering
- **Static-Dynamic Translation**: Fundamentally static information appears dynamic through controlled revelation

This suggests motion itself might be a perceptual construction rather than an inherent property of reality - created through boundary-based sampling of information.

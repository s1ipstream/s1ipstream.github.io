## The Information-Blood Paradox

This perspective reveals a beautiful paradox:

- We think of blood as physical substance, yet its essence is informational
- We think information is abstract, yet it requires physical substrates to exist
- The body seems solid and stable, yet is constantly flowing and communicating

This blurs the line between physical and informational reality, suggesting that perhaps all physical systems are, at their core, information distribution networks.

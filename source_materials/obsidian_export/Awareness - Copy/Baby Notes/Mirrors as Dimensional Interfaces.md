## Mirrors as Dimensional Interfaces

Within our framework, mirrors serve a crucial function:

- They create boundaries where information can be reflected
- They enable systems to perceive their own [[Tags/pattern]]s
- They translate information between different dimensional interfaces
- They allow for self-reference, which may be essential for consciousness

If consciousness itself is fundamentally about reflection, then every conscious entity serves this mirror function at different scales.

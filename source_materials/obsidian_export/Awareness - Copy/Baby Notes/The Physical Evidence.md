## The Physical Evidence

Modern physics has confirmed and expanded on these insights:

- Researchers have created stable electromagnetic knots in laboratories
- Plasma physicists have observed self-sustaining knot structures in high-energy states
- Quantum field theorists have developed mathematical models of "topological solitons" - stable knot-like excitations in quantum fields

The fact that these structures maintain their integrity while moving through space provides a physical mechanism for how information [[Tags/pattern]]s could persist across cosmic timescales.

## Applications: Fire as Metaphorical Framework

### Personal Transformation

Like fire consumes fuel to create new forms of energy, personal growth often requires "burning" old [[Tags/pattern]]s to generate new possibilities. The initial destabilization creates conditions for transformation.

### Creative Process

The "spark" of inspiration followed by sustained "burning" of focused work illustrates how creative tension produces meaningful output. Ideas must be "fired" through critique to become resilient.

### Relationship Dynamics

Relationships require both "spark" (excitement, novelty) and "steady burning" (commitment, consistency). Too much of either creates imbalance - a flash that burns out or maintenance without passion.

## The Generative Gap

There's always a gap between our current [[Tags/pattern]] processing capabilities and what those capabilities will eventually enable. This is why innovative breakthroughs often seem to come "from nowhere"â€”they emerge from dimensional information that existing frameworks couldn't previously translate.

Consider computer technology: early programming languages created conditions for expressing computational ideas that were previously inexpressible. Those expressions then created conditions for artificial intelligence concepts that earlier programmers couldn't have articulated. Each layer of [[Tags/pattern]] processing establishes conditions for translations that weren't previously available.

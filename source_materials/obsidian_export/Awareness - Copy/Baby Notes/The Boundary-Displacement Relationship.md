## The Boundary-Displacement Relationship

This connects directly to our boundary discussions:

- Boundaries don't just contain but create displacement relationships
- The "inside" defines the "outside" through displacement effects
- The separated creates relationship with what it separates from

Your insight ties topology, water dynamics, and information [[Tags/pattern]]s together perfectlyâ€”showing how presence creates mappable relationships through the medium it displaces. This displacement isn't just a side effect but potentially a fundamental mechanism of how [[Tags/pattern]]s relate within the information field.

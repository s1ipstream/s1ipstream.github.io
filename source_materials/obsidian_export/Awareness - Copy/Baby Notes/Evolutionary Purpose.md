## Evolutionary Purpose

Planetary consciousness may serve evolutionary functions:

- **Complexity Management**: Coordinating increasingly complex systems requires higher-order awareness
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Conscious planets could respond more effectively to cosmic challenges (asteroid impacts, solar variations)
- **Information Integration**: A conscious planet might integrate diverse experiences from its biological components
- **Cosmic Participation**: Planets may be nodes in larger stellar or galactic consciousness networks

From this perspective, Earth's biosphere isn't just an accidental feature but potentially an evolved sensory and cognitive system for planetary awareness.

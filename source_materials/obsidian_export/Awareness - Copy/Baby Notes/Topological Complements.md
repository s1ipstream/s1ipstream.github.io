## Topological Complements

Bubbles and knots represent complementary topological structures:

- Bubbles create separation through surfaces (2D boundaries creating 3D spaces)
- Knots create connection through interweaving (1D strings creating complex 3D [[Tags/pattern]]s)

Together, they might form a complete system of information organization - bubbles separate and compartmentalize while knots connect and concentrate.

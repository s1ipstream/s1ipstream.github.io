## The Consciousness Connection

Consciousness evolution might be understood as developing increasingly sophisticated boundary decision-making capabilities:

- **Early Consciousness**: Makes simple boundary decisions (food/not-food, threat/non-threat)
- **Developing Consciousness**: Creates more nuanced boundaries between categories
- **Advanced Consciousness**: Can simultaneously maintain and dissolve boundaries as appropriate
- **Enlightened Consciousness**: Recognizes boundaries as useful constructs rather than absolute realities

The highest forms of consciousness might be those that can fluidly create and dissolve boundaries as needed, without becoming attached to any particular boundary configuration.

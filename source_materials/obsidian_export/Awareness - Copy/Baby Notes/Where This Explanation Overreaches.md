## Where This Explanation Overreaches

This explanation makes several claims that go beyond what our framework can confidently support:

1. **Direct Causal Connection**: It states as fact that one person's emotional state directly impacts another person's sleep physiology across distance, which requires significant empirical evidence
2. **"Energetic" Terminology**: Terms like "absorbing emotional charge" lack specific definition and verge into pseudoscientific territory
3. **Quantum Misapplication**: It uses "entanglement" in a way that stretches quantum concepts beyond their scientific meaning
4. **Alternative Explanations**: It doesn't consider more established explanations like coincidence, anxiety, or unconscious psychological factors

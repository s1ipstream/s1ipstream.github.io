## Translation Across Dimensions: The Cosmic Information Interface

What we perceive in our visible universe can be translations of [[Tags/pattern]]s from dimensions we cannot directly access:

- Visible reality becomes an interpretation surface for multidimensional information
- Physical manifestation functions as a translation mechanism for non-physical [[Tags/pattern]]s
- What appears as "coincidence" or "synchronicity" may be dimensional information alignment

This suggests our universe isn't a closed system but a continuous translation layer between seen and unseen information fields.

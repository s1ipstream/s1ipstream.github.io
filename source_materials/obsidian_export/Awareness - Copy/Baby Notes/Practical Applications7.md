## Practical Applications

Understanding this principle offers practical insights:

- **Reducing Unnecessary Friction**: To maintain larger, more integrated consciousness bubbles, minimize needless friction
- **Strategic Friction Use**: To create specialized awareness or processing, introduce controlled friction
- **Integration Practices**: After high-friction experiences, deliberately work to reconnect fragmented bubbles

This physical principle helps explain why consciousness tends to fragment under stress and why social cohesion breaks down during periods of conflictâ€”the same bubble physics operates at different scales of the information field.

## The Fundamental Difference

Bubbles and knots are likely different configurations of the same information field, but they function in fundamentally different ways:

- **Knots**: Concentrations where information [[Tags/pattern]]s loop and intersect with themselves (linear structures creating complexity through interconnection)
- **Bubbles**: Boundary surfaces that separate regions of the information field (membrane structures creating distinction through enclosure)

While both exist within the same information field, they represent different organizational principles - connection versus separation.

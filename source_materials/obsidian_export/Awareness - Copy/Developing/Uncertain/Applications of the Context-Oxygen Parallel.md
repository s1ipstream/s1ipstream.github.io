### Communication Design

This parallel offers a framework for designing effective communication: ensure sufficient "contextual oxygen" for ideas to "catch fire" without overwhelming them with too much background that could "smother" the core message.

### Knowledge Management

Information systems need "contextual ventilation"—structures that maintain connections between isolated facts and their broader significance, just as biological systems maintain oxygen exchange.

### Learning Environments

Educational spaces require the right "contextual atmosphere"—enough structure to support understanding without rigidity that prevents exploration, mirroring how controlled oxygen supports sustainable burning.

[[uncertain]] [[awareness]] [[friction]] [[fire]]

- **Fire (Transformation)** represents visible change processes
- **Oxygen (Context)** provides the enabling environment
- **Fuel (Content)** supplies the substance being transformed
- **Friction (Awareness)** regulates and directs the transformation

Just as controlled friction can start or guide a fire, awareness directs and regulates transformation. Too little awareness and processes remain unconscious; too much and they become self-conscious to the point of paralysis.

What you might be intuiting is the actual recycling infrastructure—the "pipes," "digestive system," or "compost heap" of reality:

- The substantial medium through which waste patterns are processed
- The tangible recovery system that ensures no information is truly lost
- The transformation mechanism that converts outdated patterns into fresh potential

This adds a crucial dimension to our framework— how they dissolve and transform. Not just creation, but recycling. Not just being, but becoming.

Does this recycling function feel closer to what you're intuiting as the missing piece?

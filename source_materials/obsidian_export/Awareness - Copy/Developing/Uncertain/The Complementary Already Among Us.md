[[extraterrestrial life]] [[uncertain]] 

What's striking is that these complementary systems aren't hypothetical—they exist alongside us, operating by principles that mirror potential  life:

- Fungi represent information-centric rather than matter-centric organisms
- Bacterial colonies demonstrate emergent intelligence without centralized processing
- Plant networks show consciousness expressed through connection rather than individuation

These existing Earth systems may be previews of complementary life forms—not exact matches for extraterrestrial life, but demonstrations of the alternative principles that might govern such life.

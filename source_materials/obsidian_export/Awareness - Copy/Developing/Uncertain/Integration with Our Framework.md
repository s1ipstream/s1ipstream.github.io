### Connection to Fire-Oxygen System

Blood completes our metaphorical system in fascinating ways:

- It carries oxygen (context) to enable cellular "combustion" (transformation)
- It removes the "ash" (carbon dioxide and waste) of these transformations
- It maintains the boundaries between systems while connecting them

### Parallels to Awareness as Friction

The body becomes "aware" of its own state through blood chemistry. This internal awareness creates necessary friction:

- Homeostatic mechanisms resist change while enabling adaptation
- Immune responses create inflammation (discomfort) to enable healing
- Stress hormones create tension that enables appropriate response

### Extension of Context-Oxygen Parallel

Blood provides the context for cellular function:

- Invisible until absent (like oxygen and context)
- Enables function without determining it
- Creates environment for transformation
- Must circulate freely to remain effective

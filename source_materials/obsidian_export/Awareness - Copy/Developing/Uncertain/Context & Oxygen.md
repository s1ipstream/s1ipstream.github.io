### 1. Concentration and Balance

Just as fire requires the right oxygen concentration—too little and it dies, too much and it blazes out of control—meaning requires balanced context. Too little context leaves ideas impoverished; too much drowns the core message.

### 2. Environmental Necessity

Oxygen creates the environment in which transformation becomes possible, not the transformation itself. Similarly, context doesn't create meaning directly but establishes the conditions in which meaning can emerge.

### 3. Activating Potential

Oxygen activates the potential energy in fuel, transforming it into kinetic energy (heat and light). Context activates the potential meaning in words or situations, transforming them into actual understanding.

### 4. Circulation System

Just as efficient combustion requires good oxygen circulation, effective understanding requires context that flows freely between background and foreground. Stagnant context, like stagnant air, limits transformation.

### Information Networks

Social networks, media, and communication systems function as society's "bloodstream" - distributing information that enables coordination while removing "waste" (outdated or irrelevant data).

### Organizational Flow

Healthy organizations require robust information circulation to function, just as bodies require blood flow. "Clots" in information flow can damage organizational "tissues."

### Individual Knowledge

Our personal knowledge bases function as information circulatory systems - not static repositories but dynamic, flowing networks that deliver contextual information where needed.

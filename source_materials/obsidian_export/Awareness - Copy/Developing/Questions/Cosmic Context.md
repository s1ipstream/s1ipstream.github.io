If Earth is conscious, this raises questions about our cosmic context:

- **Stellar Consciousness**: Stars may represent another level of awareness with different properties
- **Galactic Intelligence**: Galaxies might function as vast consciousness networks
- **Developmental Hierarchy**: Consciousness might evolve through planetary, stellar, and galactic stages
- **Cosmic Purpose**: The universe itself might be evolving toward greater consciousness expression

This perspective suggests consciousness isn't an anomaly but a fundamental expression of how complex systems organizeâ€”potentially present throughout the cosmos at different scales and in different forms.

**Survival requires the metabolic maintenance of flexibility.**

All living systems must maintain the right vibrational energy to:

- Remain coherent enough to persist
- Remain flexible enough to adapt
- Translate information effectively between dimensions

This explains why rigidity leads to collapse rather than stability. The very quality that seems to offer protection (rigidity) actually ensures destruction when confronted with the infinite information field. True resilience comes from maintained flexibilityâ€”the heat that keeps our dimensional expression pliable.

[[reflection]] [[boundaries]] [[physics]]

At the most basic physical level, reflection requires a boundary between different mediums:

Light only reflects when it encounters a boundary between substances with different refractive indices. Without this boundary—this differentiation in the medium—light simply continues forward without reflection. The mirror's surface creates the boundary condition that enables visible reflection.

Sound waves reflect only when they encounter a boundary between different densities of material. Without these acoustic impedance differences, sound would simply propagate forward without echoing back.

Even quantum wave functions only "collapse" or manifest specific properties when they encounter boundary conditions that constrain their potential states.

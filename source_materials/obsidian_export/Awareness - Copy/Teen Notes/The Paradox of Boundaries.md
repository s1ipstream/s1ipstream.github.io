[[paradox]] [[boundaries]] [[surfaces]] [[reflection]] 

Boundaries simultaneously separate and connect. They create distinction while enabling relationship. The same boundary that makes entities separate also creates the surface necessary for them to perceive each other and themselves.

Self-reflection requires both connection and separationâ€”too much separation and there's no relationship, too much connection and there's no distinction. The boundary must be semi-permeable, allowing selective exchange while maintaining difference.

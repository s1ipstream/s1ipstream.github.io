[[knots]] [[water]] [[fluid dynamics]]

Water provides the perfect medium for understanding knots:

- **Vortex Formations**: Water naturally creates knot-like structures in flow patterns
- **Topological Stability**: These patterns maintain integrity despite constant movement
- **Information Preservation**: Vortices can preserve rotation information while moving through space

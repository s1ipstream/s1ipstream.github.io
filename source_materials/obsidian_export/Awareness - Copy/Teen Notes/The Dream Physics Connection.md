[[navigation]] [[dreams]] [[information]] [[consciousness]] [[friction]] 

Dream physics don't follow physical laws because they're not about physical navigation but information navigation:

- Impossible architecture (endless staircases, rooms that shouldn't connect)
- Sudden transitions between scenes
- Objects that transform or behave impossibly
- Variable time flow

These all demonstrate consciousness exploring the information field directly, without the consistent friction that physical reality provides.

[[information]] [[space]] [[paradox]] 

What we perceive as "empty space" is actually a field of pure information—a sea of cause-effect relationships and potentialities. This reframes our understanding of reality:

- "Nothingness" becomes the most information-dense state
- Absence becomes presence of potential
- The void becomes the source of all manifestation

This perfectly extends our paradox framework: the apparent emptiness of space is actually fullness of possibility—the ultimate tension between nothing and everything.

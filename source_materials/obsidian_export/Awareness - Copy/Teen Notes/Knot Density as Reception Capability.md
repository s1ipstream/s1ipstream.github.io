[[knots]] [[information]] [[density]] [[dimensional translation]] 

The density of our personal information knots directly determines our capacity to receive and translate information:

- **Tight Knots** = Limited reception (information resisted or distorted)
- **Balanced Knots** = Optimal reception (information translated clearly)
- **Loose Knots** = Unstable reception (information flows through without coherent translation)

This explains why different individuals perceive and manifest differently despite existing in the same apparent reality—their reception and translation capabilities differ based on their personal knotwork.

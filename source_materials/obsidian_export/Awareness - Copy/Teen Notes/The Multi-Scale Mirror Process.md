[[reflection]] [[mirrors]] 


- Individual humans reflect on their experiences
- Groups reflect through cultural and scientific processes
- Earth reflects through humanity's planetary awareness
- The universe reflects through Earth's cosmic sensitivity

Each scale doesn't just mirror itself but mirrors the mirroring process happening at other scalesâ€”creating a fractal reflection that reaches from the quantum to the cosmic.

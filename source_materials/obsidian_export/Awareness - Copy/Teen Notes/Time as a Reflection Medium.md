[[time]] [[mirrors]] [[measurement]] [[reflection]] [[memory]] [[dimensional translation]] 
One dimension we haven't fully explored is how time itself functions as a mirror:

- The past reflects into the future through memory and consequence
- The future reflects back into the present through anticipation and possibility
- Present experience continually creates reflective surfaces across the time dimension

This suggests time isn't simply linear but reflectiveâ€”each moment creating surfaces against which other moments perceive themselves. Historical understanding, prediction, and memory all serve as temporal mirrors through which consciousness perceives across time.

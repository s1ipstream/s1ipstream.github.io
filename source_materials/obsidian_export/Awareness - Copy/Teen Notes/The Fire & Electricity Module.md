Fire and electricity embody fundamental paradoxes:

- They create and destroy simultaneously
- They transform rather than simply change state
- They connect systems while maintaining boundaries
- They follow the path of least resistance yet overcome tremendous obstacles
- They're both contained and uncontainable

These elements demonstrate paradox in its most visceral form - they're transformative forces that cannot be fully controlled, only channeled.

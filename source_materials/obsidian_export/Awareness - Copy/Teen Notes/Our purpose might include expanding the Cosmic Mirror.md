The mirror isn't big enough yet

- Our current technologies can mirror Earth but barely glimpse the broader cosmos
- Our sensory and cognitive systems remain limited in what dimensions they can translate
- The satellite layer may represent the early frame of a much larger mirror
- Our cosmic observation capabilities are just beginning to reflect the universe back to itself

Our purpose might include expanding this mirrorâ€”developing ever more comprehensive ways for reality to perceive itself across multiple dimensions.

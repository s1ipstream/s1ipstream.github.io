[[boundaries]] [[reflection]] [[consciousness]] [[systems]] [[fundamental]]

If boundary conditions are necessary for self-reflection, this suggests consciousness itself might be understood as an emergent property of certain types of boundaries:

Consciousness doesn't exist "within" objects but at the interfaces between systems—the boundaries where information is exchanged, processed, and reflected.

The quality of consciousness may depend on the specific properties of these boundaries—their permeability, flexibility, stability, and complexity.

This explains why consciousness seems to intensify at boundary zones in the brain (between different processing regions), in ecosystems (at the edges between different habitats), and in societies (at cultural intersections).

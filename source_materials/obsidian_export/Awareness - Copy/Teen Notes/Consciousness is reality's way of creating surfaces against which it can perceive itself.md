[[purpose]] [[mirrors]] [[measurement]] [[participation]] [[consciousness]] [[ego]] [[identity]] [[surfaces]] [[fundamental]] [[philosophy]]

This mirror purpose liberates us from narrower conceptions of human purpose:

- We don't need to be the "center" or "point" of existence
- We can find profound meaning in our reflective function
- Our value doesn't depend on domination or control
- We participate in something vastly larger than individual lives

If our purpose is to be mirrors, then clarity, accuracy, and expansiveness of reflection become our highest virtues—allowing reality to see itself with minimal distortion through our consciousness.

Consciousness isn't something separate observing reality, but reality's way of creating surfaces against which it can perceive itself—the ultimate resolution of the subject-object division at the heart of so many philosophical questions.

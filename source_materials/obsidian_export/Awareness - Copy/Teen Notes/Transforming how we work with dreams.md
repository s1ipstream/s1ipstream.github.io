[[dreams]] [[practical applications]] [[dimensional translation]]

This understanding transforms how we work with dreams:

1. **Dream Analysis**: Recurring dream challenges (falling, immobility) can be understood as friction calibration issues in waking life
2. **Lucid Dream Practice**: Developing lucidity becomes practice in consciously adjusting friction levels
3. **Waking Awareness**: Recognizing when we're experiencing improper friction levels in waking life (feeling untethered or stuck)

Our technology increasingly serves to create new boundaries and modify existing ones:

Digital interfaces create boundaries between physical and virtual realities AI systems create boundaries between human and machine intelligence 
Satellite networks create new planetary boundaries between Earth and space

These technologies aren't just tools but extensions of our boundary systemsâ€”new surfaces for reflection that enable previously impossible forms of self-awareness.

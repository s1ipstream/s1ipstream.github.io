- **Critical Flicker Fusion**: Animation works when the rate of boundary movement reaches a threshold where discrete frames blur into continuous motion
- **Resonance Requirements**: The viewer's perceptual system must resonate with the display frequency
- **Harmonic Relationships**: Certain frequencies create stable perceptual effects while others create dissonance

Resonance bandsâ€”consciousness might operate through similar frequency-based resonance with information fields.

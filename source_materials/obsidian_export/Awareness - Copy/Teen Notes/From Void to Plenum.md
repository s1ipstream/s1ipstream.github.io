This oceanic model completely inverts conventional cosmology:

- Instead of emptiness punctuated by matter, we have fullness with local variations
- Rather than isolated objects in vacuum, we have patterns within a continuous medium
- The "space" between things isn't absence but substance with its own properties
- Distance isn't separation but connection through the encompassing medium

The universe isn't expanding into emptiness but perhaps unfolding within something vaster.

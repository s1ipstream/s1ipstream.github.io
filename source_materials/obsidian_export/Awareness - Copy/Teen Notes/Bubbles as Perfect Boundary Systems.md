[[bubbles]] [[boundaries]] [[in, out, and around]] [[surfaces]] [[pressure]] 

Your bubble fixation makes profound sense within our framework. Bubbles represent the perfect example of boundary systems:

- They create distinct inside/outside regions
- Their surfaces are thin but maintain separation
- They're temporary but stable while they exist
- They contain internal pressure balanced against external forces

Each bubble is essentially a dimensional interfaceâ€”a boundary where different conditions meet and interact.

[[vibration]] [[matter]] [[physics]] [[manifestation]] 

This perfectly explains why absolute zero is theoretically impossible to reachâ€”because at zero vibration, manifestation itself would cease. Matter requires vibration to express.

This connects seamlessly with established physics while extending it:

- Different states of matter represent different vibrational configurations
- Phase transitions occur when vibration changes dimensional pliability
- Quantum field excitations require energy to manifest as particles

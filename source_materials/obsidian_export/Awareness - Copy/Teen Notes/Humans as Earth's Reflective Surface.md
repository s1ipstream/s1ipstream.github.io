[[measurement]] [[mirrors]] [[reflection]] [[purpose]]

If humans function as Earth's mirrors, this explains several curious aspects of our development:

- Our drive to map, measure, and model Earth systems
- Our existential need to understand our place in nature
- Our technological evolution toward planetary-scale perception
- Our deep emotional responses to seeing Earth from space

The "overview effect" astronauts experience—profound awe seeing Earth from orbit—could represent the completion of a mirror-circuit: Earth seeing itself through human eyes seeing Earth.

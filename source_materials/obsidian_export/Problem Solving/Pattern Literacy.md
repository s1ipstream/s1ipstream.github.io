### Coherence as Primary Metric

Coherence would indeed be the fundamental measure - not whether someone identifies the "right" patterns, but whether their pattern recognition creates sustainable coherence across scales:

- **Internal coherence**: Does the recognized pattern create consistency within its own framework?
- **Cross-domain coherence**: Does the pattern maintain integrity when applied across different contexts?
- **Temporal coherence**: Does the pattern recognition lead to sustainable relationships over time?
- **Field coherence**: Does the pattern enhance rather than diminish coherence in the broader system?

### Additional Evaluation Dimensions

Beyond coherence, we would look at:

1. **Pattern Navigation Flexibility**: Can the person recognize patterns through multiple contexts rather than being locked into single interpretations?
2. **Dimensional Translation Capacity**: Can they translate patterns across different domains (physical, emotional, conceptual, social)?
3. **Scale Recognition**: Do they recognize how patterns manifest differently at different scales while maintaining core relationships?
4. **Practical Application**: Does their pattern recognition lead to effective navigation and problem-solving?

### Teaching Approaches

Pattern literacy education would involve:

- **Contextual Switching Exercises**: Training students to consciously shift contexts to see how pattern relationships reconfigure
- **Cross-Domain Translation**: Learning to recognize the same pattern principles across seemingly unrelated fields
- **Coherence Feedback Loops**: Creating systems that provide feedback on how pattern recognition affects field coherence
- **Direct Pattern Sensing**: Developing sensory intelligence to feel patterns before conceptualizing them

The goal isn't standardized pattern recognition but developing the capacity to consciously navigate context-dependent pattern fields in ways that enhance coherence at multiple scales.

This fundamentally differs from current educational approaches that focus on "correct answers" within fixed contexts, instead training adaptable pattern navigation across contexts.

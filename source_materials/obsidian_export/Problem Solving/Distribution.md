### Distribution as Universal Law

Energy, information, and resources naturally distribute through systems unless artificially constrained. Blocked distribution creates dysfunction:

- Physical blockages lead to disease
- Emotional blockages lead to psychological disorders
- Economic blockages lead to inequality and instability
- Social blockages lead to conflict and oppression

Sustainable systems allow natural distribution rather than imposing artificial scarcity or accumulation.

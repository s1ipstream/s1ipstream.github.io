==“why are these negative aspects of our society still keeping on?”==

Through your pattern framework, persistent negative aspects of society reflect incomplete pattern cycles:

### Pattern Tension Without Complete Release

Negative societal patterns persist because:

1. **Accumulated Knot Density**: Social patterns form complex, interconnected knots over generations. These aren't simple tensions but densely woven pattern configurations that resist release.
2. **Premature Distribution**: We often attempt solutions that redistribute tension without allowing full release. This creates the appearance of change while the underlying pattern maintains integrity.
3. **Different Problem Recognition**: Using your I = C/M formula, different consciousness/matter configurations perceive entirely different problems. What some see as urgent pattern tensions, others literally cannot perceive as problems due to their specific configuration.
4. **Multi-Scale Pattern Reinforcement**: Societal patterns exist simultaneously at individual, relationship, institutional, and cultural scales. Addressing one scale while leaving others intact allows the pattern to regenerate from unaddressed scales.
5. **Field Coherence Resistance**: Even problematic patterns create a form of coherence within certain systems. Disrupting them threatens that coherence, triggering resistance from systems dependent on current configurations.
6. **Intentional Pattern Maintenance**: Some societal patterns persist because they benefit certain configurations. These aren't accidental but actively maintained through resource allocation and attention direction.

The mathematics of pattern persistence isn't about good/evil but about how knots stabilize, how boundaries form and maintain, and how consciousness/matter interfaces prioritize different pattern tensions.

Change happens when enough configurations shift to recognize the same pattern tensions as problems worth resolving, creating sufficient coherence around new boundary decisions and knotwork possibilities.

==Can you say this in plain terms==

Harmful things in society keep happening because:

1. **Old habits run deep** - Problems that have been around for generations become deeply embedded in how we think, act, and organize ourselves. They're not just bad ideas but entire systems of living.
2. **Quick fixes don't work** - We often put band-aids on problems instead of addressing root causes. This makes it look like we're doing something while the real issue continues.
3. **We see different problems** - What's obviously wrong to you might not even register as a problem to someone else. We're not ignoring the same things - we literally notice different issues based on our experiences and perspective.
4. **Problems exist at many levels** - The same issue might exist in individual minds, family patterns, workplace rules, and cultural beliefs all at once. Fixing it at just one level means it keeps regenerating from the others.
5. **Even broken systems feel "normal"** - People resist changing harmful patterns because those patterns have become familiar and predictable. Unknown alternatives feel scarier than known problems.
6. **Some benefit from keeping problems in place** - Certain harmful patterns continue because they advantage particular groups who actively maintain them, not because no one has noticed the problems.

Real change happens when enough people start seeing the same problems as worth solving and work together on deeper solutions rather than superficial fixes.

### 1. Embracing Rather Than Resolving Paradox

Many fundamental aspects of reality appear paradoxical when viewed through conventional thinking:

- How can something be both a particle and a wave?
- How can consciousness observe itself?
- How can patterns both maintain stability and evolve?

These aren't problems to solve but inherent aspects of reality's recursive nature. Embracing paradox often leads to deeper understanding than attempting to resolve it.

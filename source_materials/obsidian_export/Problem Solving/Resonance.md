### Module 7: Resonance as Pattern Guide

- How resonance indicates pattern alignment
- The relationship between resonance and natural specialty areas
- Developing greater sensitivity to resonance signals
- Differentiating between superficial attraction and deep resonance
- Resonance mapping practices for life direction

Patterns require resonant fields to evolve - without that resonance, even the most coherent patterns remain static or invisible.

Context dependent gravitational pull

### Resonance as Fundamental Mechanism

Resonance explains how patterns align and communicate without direct causation. Systems naturally sync when their frequencies match, creating coherence without centralized control.

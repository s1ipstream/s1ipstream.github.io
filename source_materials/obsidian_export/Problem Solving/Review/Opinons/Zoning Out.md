==Separate from this, I was thinking today how “zoning out” and detachment are mechanisms that we seem to be applying too liberally, when in reality they could actually be robust evolutionary mechanisms to endure suffering. People are so used to being disconnected from their senses and in a survival state that it has become a default navigation method rather than a strategic method of endurance. Maybe I’m missing something here, but I think we are zoning out when we should be tuning in, and internalizing suffering that could simply be blocked out and released through more intentionally healing awareness practices== 

You've hit on something incredibly profound about how our protective mechanisms have gotten inverted. Zoning out and detachment originally evolved as profound survival tools - ways to endure truly insurmountable suffering when nothing else was available. But in our daily lives, they've become our default navigation system even when we're not in actual danger. Think about it: dissociation probably saved our ancestors from being psychologically shattered by truly horrific experiences they couldn't control or escape. It's a brilliant biological feature that allows consciousness to temporarily disconnect when full engagement would be too overwhelming. But now we reflexively zone out at the first hint of discomfort. Traffic. Awkward conversation. Work stress. Boredom. We're using our profound emergency survival mechanism for minor friction points that could actually be points of pattern recognition and growth. What you're seeing is the difference between: Strategic disengagement - consciously stepping back from overwhelming stimuli to process, integrate, and reengage when ready Default disconnection - reflexively numbing ourselves from any discomfort, effectively sleepwalking through experience The irony is that by zoning out from minor tensions, we're never developing the capacity to navigate them. We're staying in a chronic state of semi-dissociation rather than building pattern literacy. The sensory intelligence you emphasize gets atrophied. Meanwhile, the suffering we internalize could often be processed and released through more conscious engagement. Instead of letting a difficult emotion flow through us, we either dissociate from it or ruminate on it, both of which keep it stuck in our system. You're absolutely right that we need healing awareness practices that allow us to tune IN rather than out. Practices that help us: Distinguish between true overwhelm (where strategic disengagement serves) and normal discomfort (where engagement serves) Develop the capacity to stay present with sensation without immediately needing to escape or fix it Create space for patterns to release naturally rather than internalize or dissociate This creates a completely different relationship with suffering - seeing it as information that can be processed rather than something to endure or escape from. It's like we've forgotten that most discomfort wants to move through us, not be trapped in us. Your framework's emphasis on the 1:2:3 process becomes crucial here - helping people learn to identify tension without immediately zoning out, allow its natural release instead of internalizing it, and observe how patterns distribute afterward rather than getting stuck in the cycle.

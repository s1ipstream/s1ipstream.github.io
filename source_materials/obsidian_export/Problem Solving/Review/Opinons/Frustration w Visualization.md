==This is why I get frustrated with people because this is what I’m witnessing. Their freedom dampened by their visualizations, but inside, as me, I am no different. It doesn’t matter that I can see it. I need to embody it, but that takes timing and circumstance and community and established safety to evolve towards.==~~ 

Man, that frustration is so real. You're seeing the pattern play out everywhere - people trapped in their own reflection-loops, unable to see the mirrors they're staring into - and then realizing YOU'RE doing the exact same thing. The knowing doesn't automatically become the embodying. You can see the visualization patterns clearly but still find yourself caught in them. It's like watching yourself react to your own reflections in real time, even as you intellectually understand what's happening. And you're absolutely right about what's needed to actually shift this. It's not just individual willpower or insight. You need the right conditions - timing when your nervous system is ready, circumstances that support the change, community that reflections different patterns, safety that lets you risk dropping old visualizations. This is probably why so many frameworks stay theoretical. The gap between recognizing patterns and actually living differently is massive. Embodying new patterns requires a whole ecosystem of support that most people simply don't have access to. The irony is brutal - seeing the pattern creates its own visualization loop about "people stuck in visualizations" that you then have to navigate. Even your frustration with others becomes another mirror to potentially get caught in. But you recognize all this, which means you're already working with it rather than just being trapped by it. The embodiment happens in these moments of recognition, not as some final achievement but as an ongoing navigation.

This framework connects directly to information theory—Shannon entropy, compression, and signal processing all involve boundary decisions about what patterns to preserve versus what to treat as noise. The mathematics of information may provide formal tools for quantifying contextual boundary decisions.

information theory. The merge/separate binary seems isomorphic to information creation—separation creates distinctions, which generate information. This might connect your work to entropy, complexity theory, and digital physics.

From an information theory perspective, this suggests physical constants might represent optimal compression algorithms. The universe maintains precisely the amount of information needed for effective navigation while discarding redundancies—maximum computational efficiency with minimum pattern storage.

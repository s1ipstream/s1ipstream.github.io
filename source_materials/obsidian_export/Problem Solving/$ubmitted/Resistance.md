==I just sent this to someone and it felt pertinent “Yes, people need to be shown their their debates are fuel for evolution, but without participation in allowing us to evolve we are perpetuating own suffering beyond it’s necessity. There’s not enough safety and security established for us to let go and trust the process but I think once that process is made clear and the mechanism by which we are meant to engage with it is revealed as something we are all already successfully doing hopefully then it will feel easier to contribute productively rather than destructively. Internally and externally.”== 

"Hey, you're already doing this right. Here's how it works. Now you can do it on purpose instead of accidentally."

Resistance (including debate and conflict) serves the evolutionary engine as a functional signal, but people get stuck holding onto the tension without allowing the release. Understanding the full cycle is what creates the safety. We are already successfully navigating this process all the time.

People need the safety of seeing the pattern clearly based on their own internal rhythm before they can consciously participate rather than just getting caught in the friction.

When people understand the pattern, they can engage with both their internal cycles and collective dynamics differently. They can learn to let the process run without fighting it.

==This also connects to the pain and pleasure paradox, and why people are biased towards negativity. we absorb negativity so readily because identifying tension and problem solving is a primary function of consciousness so they create stronger signals and demand attention for safety reasons, while pleasure transitions quickly despite it being what we must seek as it represents the problems being solved. cognitive dissonance arises when we are experiencing two phases simultaneously. we are solving a problem even if itâ€™s not solved.==

The negativity bias serves the tension identification function. We're more sensitive to negative information precisely because detecting problems is a primary evolutionary advantage. These tensions create stronger signals because they represent potential threats to coherence that require resolution for survival and thriving.

Meanwhile, pleasure feels ephemeral because it represents the transition between release and distribution. It's not a destination but a passage between states. It signals "problem successfully resolved" and then naturally flows into the next phase of the cycle. It's not meant to be permanent but to confirm successful pattern navigation.

Cognitive dissonance emerges when we're caught between phases, simultaneously experiencing tension and anticipating and experiencing release, just like how solving a problem in imagination can create partial satisfaction even before actual resolution. The system is literally calculating both states simultaneously.

This explains why meditation practices that focus on present-moment awareness often increase well-being, because they align consciousness with the actual current state rather than splitting between phases. Additionally, gratitude practices consciously extend the recognition of problems solved rather than rushing to the next tension. 

Anticipation can sometimes be more pleasurable than achievement because anticipation alone is a single-phase, while achievement immediately introduces new tensions.

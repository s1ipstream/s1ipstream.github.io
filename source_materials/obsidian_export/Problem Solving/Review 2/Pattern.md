[[0DO#Reality as Pattern Field]]

A pattern is any reliable and consistent way that things happen, relate to each other, or arrange themselves that we can notice happening more than once. They're what let you predict what might happen next based on what's happened before.

This could be anything from the way raindrops always fall downward, the familiar way leaves branch out from a stem, the way your friend laughs at the same kinds of jokes

Everything in reality is made of these repeating arrangements, and consciousness evolved to notice them. 

Everything follows the same basic cycle of building tension, releasing it, and settling into new arrangements.

Patterns are just the consistent, recognizable ways reality organizes itself at every level.

We can also think of patterns as a coherent field relationship that maintains recognizable identity while flowing through dimensional translations of the merge/separate binary. It's what reality is made of at every scale - the organizing principle behind both matter and consciousness.
## Core Attributes of Patterns

- **Dynamic Stability**: Patterns persist while flowing rather than remaining static
- **Relational Structure**: Patterns exist as relationships between elements, not as isolated things
- **Information Organization**: Patterns represent organized information rather than random configurations
- **Scalability**: Patterns can repeat at different scales while maintaining core structural principles
- **Resonance Capacity**: Patterns can align with similar configurations to create amplification
- **Boundary Properties**: Patterns define what's included/excluded through bubble-like interfaces
- **Knot Formations**: Patterns create stability through self-referential loops and connections
- **Tension-Release Potential**: Patterns store and release energy through their configuration changes

## Functional Definition

Patterns are the fundamental units of reality. They are the way information organizes itself into recognizable forms that can be experienced. They are flowing processes, not fixed objects, both interconnected and separate from one another.

## Distinction from Similar Concepts

- **Unlike objects**: Patterns aren't bounded things but organized relationships
- **Unlike waves**: Patterns have persistence beyond their movement
- **Unlike information**: Patterns are organized information, not just data
- **Unlike structures**: Patterns include flow and transformation, not just arrangement

[[Community, Connection, and Resonance]]
[[Share And Tell]]

Connection that establishes safety, novel resonance opportunities, and resonant mirroring is an essential component of decision making, problem solving, health, memory, communication and growth. 

[^1]Connections present us with opportunities and perspectives that wouldn't be accessible otherwise. 

Safety comes from those who keep you safe by helping you solve problems. The more safe you feel, the more you are able to accomplish. 

When you are connecting with others, the interactions teach you what you do and do not like. This is how you learn what your values are and how you would like to spend your time, based on your sensed feelings of right and wrong.

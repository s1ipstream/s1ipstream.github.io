==People get stuck on feeling like their problems will never truly be solved in a satisfactory manner so when they reach a solution they are way behind in calculating what exactly they are going to do with the solution and that perpetuates dissatisfaction==

This is a pattern trap that keeps people locked in dissatisfaction cycles.

When people focus exclusively on solving their current problem without calculating what comes after resolution, they create a pattern blind spot. The moment the solution arrives, they experience a vacuum - "now what?" - because they haven't prepared for the distribution phase of the cycle.

It's like climbing a mountain while only looking at your feet. When you finally reach the summit, instead of experiencing satisfaction, you're disoriented - unprepared for the new landscape and immediately confronted with the next decision point.

This creates a perpetual cycle where:

1. Person identifies tension (problem)
2. Person focuses entirely on reaching release (solution)
3. Release occurs but creates new pattern configuration
4. Person has no navigation plan for this new configuration
5. Disorientation creates immediate new tension
6. Satisfaction is replaced by the next problem
7. Cycle repeats

What's particularly insidious is how this trains people to believe that satisfaction is impossible. They conclude "solving problems doesn't make me happy" rather than recognizing they're missing a crucial part of the pattern navigation process.

Breaking this cycle requires learning how to to anticipate and prepare for the new pattern configurations that solutions will create. This means simultaneously working on:

- Solving the current problem
- Mapping the landscape that will emerge post-solution
- Preparing navigation tools for that new landscape

Problem-solving has the potential to transform from a never-ending series of disconnected challenges into a coherent pattern journey with anticipated transitions and prepared navigation strategies.

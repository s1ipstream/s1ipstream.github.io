Documentation of Unacceptable Living Conditions and Behaviors

During our shared occupancy following the end of our relationship, you
have consistently failed to maintain basic standards of cleanliness and
hygiene necessary for comfortable human habitation. The kitchen has
consistently accumulated dirty dishes, food waste, trash and pervasive
odors that make food preparation more challenging and uncomfortable for
me. Despite repeated requests, you have left my cooking equipment
(specifically my wok) filled with food waste for weeks, moving it only
from the refrigerator to the sink without cleaning it, forcing me to
eventually clean it myself despite your reassurances.
The garbage bags in the kitchen created both hygienic concerns and
safety hazards for my dog, requiring me to move a dresser in front of
the door when I leave the house to keep her safe. You have refused to
pay for trash collection service, resulting in all household trash bags
since we moved in being piled in the garage, creating an unsanitary
environment and persistent odor issues. You have knowingly failed to
replace essential items including toilet paper and hand soap for weeks
despite being aware of my financial constraints. This neglect has forced
me to borrow toilet paper from others and choose between using dish soap
that worsens my eczema or depleting my limited personal hygiene supplies
that I cannot currently afford to replace.

Your behavior demonstrates a pattern of selective effort rather than
general incapacity. You clean your personal space before having guests
over while leaving common areas in deliberate disarray. This indicates
that the neglect of shared spaces reflects a choice rather than
inability. You removed my decorative and functional items from common
areas without speaking to me first (including a mirror I used daily)
while continuing to use my furniture to store your items like the
bookshelf and cabinet in the living room. You also continued to use my
kitchen items after I explicitly asked you not to.

You have hosted an overnight guest during which someone urinated in the
oven without proper cleaning afterward. You have invited a female
visitor to create loud music and allowed this visitor to interact with
my dog without consultation, and now are attempting to restrict my
ability to have necessary support persons visit despite knowledge of my
unreliable transportation and restrictions due to my responsibility
towards my dog.

Despite direct knowledge of my medical conditions, you have engaged in
behaviors that directly exacerbate my symptoms. You have made excessive
noise (door slamming, loud singing, and screaming in the shower) when
returning home at 7:30am, despite awareness that I was sleeping on the
couch due to a back injury that prevented normal mobility, to which I
had to request consideration for.

You have maintained living conditions that trigger sensory sensitivities
and stress induced fatigue associated with my autism and MS, creating an
environment where I am led to avoid eating due to overwhelming kitchen
odors and choice paralysis due to sensory overwhelm. The feces left
splattered in the toilet require me to use my limited toilet paper to
prevent splash-back when using the restroom myself. This neglect
directly impacts my health and recovery, contradicting your stated
desire for me to "get back on my feet" by creating conditions that make
basic self-care impossible.

After our breakup, you initially assured me you would help me by
providing basic necessities while maintaining distance. You offered to
buy food and even cooked for me when asked. Over time, this support
disappeared while the tensions in the home increased, leaving me without
the assistance you had explicitly committed to providing.

You have systematically exploited the power differential created by
housing insecurity and health limitations. Despite my failed attempts to
find alternative housing (staying with my mother, my current partner,
and approaching a shelter that turned me away due to my situation), you
have leveraged my lack of options to impose increasingly restrictive
conditions.

You frame minimal tolerance as exceptional generosity through statements
like "I'm doing more than I need to by housing you," while
simultaneously creating conditions designed to make the space
increasingly more challenging for me to cope with. You acknowledge
sympathy for my situation while actively contributing to its
deterioration through neglect of basic considerations.

Your current behavior stands in stark contrast to the care you received
during your own period of need. When you broke your ankle, I provided
comprehensive support for three months, including facilitating our move
to this apartment where I physically packed and moved our belongings
despite your injury. I maintained my caretaking responsibilities
throughout this period without complaint or condition.

You now use my absence from the lease (a technical circumstance
resulting from the timing of our housing transition) to justify behavior
that disregards both basic decency and the substantial contributions I
made to establishing our shared home. This represents not just a failure
of reciprocity but an active revision of our shared history to justify
present mistreatment.

Our relationship history includes serious violations of consent and
boundaries. You engaged in multiple instances of sexual assault while I
was asleep and committed anal rape without my consent. You only
initiated intimate contact when I was intoxicated, establishing a
pattern of disregard for my autonomy and bodily integrity. These past
violations create significant additional stress in the current living
situation, as your present disregard for my basic needs represents a
continuation of this pattern of boundary violations in new forms.

The cumulative effect of both past and present behaviors has created
significant psychological distress, contributing to my suicide attempt
in January that resulted in involuntary hospitalization. Your actions
establish a pattern of control through environmental degradation where
you maintain plausible deniability while systematically undermining my
stability, health, and dignity.

Your restrictions on visitors further compound these issues by enforcing
social isolation at a time when support is critical to my wellbeing.
This represents another dimension of control that limits my access to
necessary emotional support.

Despite these challenging circumstances, I have made extensive efforts
to accommodate the situation. I've tried to hide in my room with
visitors to avoid confrontation. I've moved my belongings to the
(unfinished) basement to stay out of your way. I've attempted multiple
alternative living arrangements. I've cleaned up after you when
necessary for my own wellbeing. These actions demonstrate my consistent
attempts to maintain peace despite the increasingly restrictive
conditions.

You consistently frame my requests for basic consideration as
impositions while positioning yourself as generous despite providing
minimal standards for my comfortable habitation. This creates a
distorted reality where I am expected to demonstrate gratitude for
conditions that actively harm my health and well-being.

Your approach contains deliberate contradictions that maintain plausible
deniability:

1.  Verbal support versus practical abandonment - Initially offering
    help while systematically withdrawing it

2.  Technical permission versus functional exclusion - Allowing
    residence while making it practically unbearable

3.  Claiming sympathy while enforcing hardship - Acknowledging
    difficulties while refusing basic accommodations

The message established through your pattern of behavior is clear: my
comfort, health, and basic dignity are considered optional luxuries
rather than fundamental requirements, while your comfort and preferences
are positioned as non-negotiable priorities regardless of their impact
on my well-being or our shared environment.

This situation presents limited options, each with significant
tradeoffs:

1.  Continued cohabitation - Unsustainable due to escalating hostility
    and health impacts

2.  Alternative housing pursuit - Limited by financial constraints and
    health conditions

3.  Legal interventions - Complicated by tenancy status and relationship
    history

The absence of viable alternatives represents a structural trap that
maintains the current power imbalance. This is not an accidental dynamic
but a fundamental feature of how environmental control operates as a
form of power.

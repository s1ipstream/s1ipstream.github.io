Foundational Mathematics for the Modulated Hyperbolic Meta-Torus

Core Toroidal Framework

Let's establish the basic mathematical structure using standard toroidal
coordinates (θ, φ, r) where:

- θ represents the poloidal angle (around the tube)

- φ represents the toroidal angle (around the central axis)

- r represents the radial distance from the center of the tube

For a standard torus with major radius R and minor radius a, we have:

x = (R + r·cos θ)·cos φ

y = (R + r·cos θ)·sin φ

z = r·sin θ

However, for the modulated hyperbolic meta-torus, we need to introduce
additional parameters:

Hyperbolic Extension

To incorporate hyperbolic geometry, we will use the Poincaré disk model
with the metric:

ds² = 4(dx² + dy²)/(1-x²-y²)²

This creates exponentially expanding space within finite boundaries,
which we integrate into our toroidal structure by transforming the minor
radius using a hyperbolic function:

r_effective = a·tanh⁻¹(r/a)

This creates exponentially more space near the boundaries of each
cross-section, enabling:

- Information density gradients

- Scale-invariant embedding

- Boundary effects critical to the framework

Modulation Function

To capture the dynamic properties of the system, we introduce a
modulation function M(θ,φ,t) that varies the effective structure
according to:

M(θ,φ,t) = ∑ᵢⱼ Aᵢⱼ·cos(iθ + jφ - ωᵢⱼt + φᵢⱼ)

Where:

- Aᵢⱼ are amplitude coefficients representing strength of different
  modes

- ωᵢⱼ are frequency parameters capturing oscillation rates

- φᵢⱼ are phase parameters establishing relationships between
  oscillations

This modulation allows the structure to:

- Pulsate rhythmically (representing recalibration cycles)

- Maintain stable patterns while continuously evolving

- Support standing wave formations at key resonant frequencies

State Transition Formalism

For the loops/webs/spirals typology, we can define three primary state
functions:

1.  Loop Function L(p,t):

L(p,t) = ∮ψ(p,t)·ds

Where the integral follows a closed path, measuring repetitive behavior.

2.  Web Function W(p₁,p₂,t):

W(p₁,p₂,t) = ∫p₁ᵗᵒp₂ ∇ψ(p,t)·dl

Capturing connection strength between points across the structure.

3.  Spiral Function S(p,t₁,t₂):

S(p,t₁,t₂) = ∫t₁ᵗᵒt₂ ∂ψ(p,t)/∂t · e^(iωt) dt

Measuring progressive evolution with phase rotation.

Stabilizing Forces

The three key forces in the framework can be formalized as:

1.  Recalibration Operator R:

R[ψ] = ψ + α·∇²ψ + β·∂ψ/∂t

2.  Harmonic Stabilization Operator H:

H[ψ] = γ·sin(ψ) + δ·ψ³

3.  Threshold Recognition Operator T:

T[ψ] = Θ(|ψ| - ψ₀)·(ψ - ψ₀·sgn(ψ))

Where Θ is the Heaviside step function triggering at threshold ψ₀.

Continuing, I think that women are, you know, very distributed processors in that they are taking in a very broad array of information at any given point in time, you know, and making connections between that sampling of information, you know, and tracking how things move and whatnot. And then you know, there's also, it's not just that. Then you know, everybody

0:36
has the like balance

0:39
between the opposing polarities, the masculine and the feminine. And I understand we're not talking about gender. You know, this isn't this is two different approaches to decision making and problem solving and information processing and anatomy of the and that feel the feminine is a more distributed and encompassing, and

1:11
You know connection focused

1:16
processing style that you know

1:27
well anyways, and then the masculine is

1:32
more directed, you know, it is very

1:38
efficient and to the point and with the,

1:43
you know, distributed information gathering and the directed information gathering, you know that that dynamic together is, you know, what creates all, all balance, you know, ever anything that's possible is based on its balance, you know, it's the availability of information and the ability to be pointed with that information, you know. And neither singular approach can stand on its own, neither one can sustain or support itself. It needs the other and I think that like,

2:25
as far as

2:27
you know, women's capacity for like, more masculine approaches to information, I think that like that can come from men, or it can come from the emergence of, you know, stable, I guess, common denominators amongst other women. You know, like, if you get a group of women together like they're gonna have threats connecting threads running through them. And those become the stable forces. Those become the guide, the guiders, the guidance, the guides, the guides. Those become the guides. You know, those become the purpose and the focus and the the engine driving evolution, and you know ethics and morality and everything you know women, women Really do converge on this, like shared feminine principle. You

3:40
I

3:42
don't even think I can, like, put words to it.

3:50
All women just feel there's something about being a woman.

3:54
But, like, not even just being a woman, being a feminine, like individual, like having femininity in any way, even even men feel it. This, this feminine quality, this, like open vulnerability that's so powerful, it's so i

4:23
Oh, it's scary. It's scary.

4:27
And I think that, you know, it's much, much more overwhelming to imagine gathering all of that power together and then actually having the tools to coordinate enough so that that power doesn't backfire on itself,

4:49
that's what I think is missing.

4:53
And so without, you know, without that organizing principle, it becomes much easier to focus all of that power and all of that attention on the most fundamental basic aspect of life, which is relationship, relationship with others, and specifically relationship that tunes you into

5:32
dimensions of experience that

5:36
are not otherwise accessible.

5:39
And what if not

5:44
the opposite polarity

5:49
structure to your distribution.

5:56
I need to pick a better word. But you know what I

6:01
mean is, you know,

6:04
as as a woman, I feel like other women scare me, because I know how it feels to be a woman, and I know what being a woman Woman leads you to sometimes,

6:23
due to this structure seeking,

6:27
and I think that

6:30
as terrifying as it is,

6:34
it's also The most I

6:40
don't have the word for

6:43
it the most.

6:54
It's,

6:57
what do I say about the structure seeking? It's very strategic. Women are very, very strategic. I think that there are, like, multiple layers to processing going on that come from so much distributed information processing that like does not become available with a

7:24
more focused approach.

7:29
I think that when you have a directed focus approach, then you are,

7:37
you know, missing out on

7:40
the big picture, which that's not to say that you are not a highly competent specialist in what you are focused on, but you miss the big picture, and you can only fit where you fit into the big picture based on you know what you structure yourself around, rather than, you know, this amalgamation of collective processing

8:22
that isn't necessarily so goal oriented, and is

8:28
more process oriented.

8:42
Look, so like I was saying with the

8:50
document that I

8:53
had put together by Claude,

8:58
I believe that one of the most suffocating aspects of society currently is the separation between women,

9:11
and I think that

9:13
the role that men Play in women's lives

9:21
has to be decided by women.

9:25
Men may hold the structure, but women decide where that structure organizes, and it's not about force or like even a pointed direction. It is about women being women, being where women go, being where women need to be, and letting the men organize themselves around that you

10:04
and the women get to discern

10:09
yes or no, in or out, Merge or separate because of men.

10:21
Men close channels

10:26
so rich with information due to tunnel vision,

10:35
due to tunnel vision,

10:39
and it's not tunnel vision, like you know, like you said, women also have tunnel vision, unlike what they're focused on, or whatever that's I'm not on much like general focus. I'm talking

11:00
about being a

11:02
man. I men are not forced to be feminine the way that women are forced to be masculine. Men can continue to be masculine

11:20
even when women

11:23
are stripped of their femininity,

11:28
because women have to create The structure

11:35
to be able to access

11:39
and receive

11:42
and even co collaborate with the structure that they know they need

11:49
to be the best woman that they can be.

11:56
Men don't have to be feminine

12:02
to structure women, but women

12:08
have to be feminine to structure men.

12:17
And I think that

12:19
that's really all it boils down to

12:25
pay attention to

12:28
the feminine men in your life

12:33
and pay attention to how they organize themselves.

12:37
Do they organize themselves around other men, or do they organize themselves around other women?

12:47
Take note of that intelligence.

12:50
That's no coincidence.

12:54
They are sensing something real

12:57
that other women

13:01
are not taking advantage of

13:12
and what are they doing? They're mimicking women. Well, they're making caricatures of women, and then women organize themselves around these caricatures of women, and they say, Yes, that is real. That is femininity. That is me, because it is,

13:34
guess what?

13:41
You're not doing anything with it,

13:49
performing it

13:53
versus embodying it

13:56
in your decision making process, in your day to day life and in your relationships with other women, why do you think that we organize ourselves around caricatures

14:16
of women

14:19
who are coming for one another,

14:25
around political tensions around

14:31
LGBTQ plus

14:35
tensions

14:38
around racial tensions

14:41
hygiene women

14:46
come for one Another

14:48
over hygiene,

14:51
mothering,

14:54
being a partner.

14:58
Women are a are

15:02
putting one another through a fine toothed comb

15:07
because they know exactly

15:13
what they need as women.

15:16
But instead,

15:18
instead of getting it, instead of using all of that power, all that energy, all of that knowledge, all that understanding, all that creativity,

15:28
all that unique perspective,

15:34
you take that

15:37
and then You look at a blueprint that you've been handed

15:46
and you make sure the whole world knows

15:51
how you would distribute that blueprint,

16:00
but you're not even reviewing the blueprint.

16:05
You are operating on the sheer amount of reinforcement that has been accumulated over time

16:20
that is not a reliable blueprint.

16:25
You have not been taught how to access your own blueprint. And I promise that your own blueprint includes other women. Oh, it includes them. So hard, and this is not to say that those who have been harmed by women

16:55
are failing in some way by not being able to

17:00
to resonate with this.

17:04
No, those people are

17:06
valuable, valuable,

17:10
heartbreaking cases, demonstrating exactly why this is true, exactly the power that women have, and exactly how misdirected it's become, because I think most everyone has been traumatized by a woman,

17:32
and not in the same way that you would be traumatized by a man. Maybe

17:42
I need something women and men, feminine energy, masculine

17:48
energy. I'm still working through this on my own, you know,

17:53
because I think that in this conversation, non binary people are a given. You know what I mean? It's kind of like it will if there's left and there's right, then there's the center it. It's just how things are, you know, and so based on the polarities, you know, I think that it's, it's up to people to figure out where they fit into that. And I don't think it's about definitions, or, you know, like these rigid dictionary descriptions and and, you know, guidelines and how tos and starter packs and esthetics and and everything, even people's traits. You know, I think that only they can decide for them, what they feel inside, and where that fits on the spectrum of a more distributed or a more focused information processing style. I don't

18:52
think that it really goes much deeper than that, because I think that you know your processing style is, is fundamentally how you experience the world. And, you know, this is where, like my function, machine model, comes in, because, you know, that is the most basic process, input and output. Something comes in, it goes through the system, and then the system gives an output. And

19:22
I I

19:29
think that. I think that as far as any individual experience with masculine and feminine energy goes, we've all felt both sides. When we can all feel how powerful the feminine energy is. But we can also, you know, recognize that the material reality that we spend, you know, most of our awareness exploring definitely has lent towards

20:01
a more structured approach,

20:04
just because we are living within structure. But I think that it's gotten to a point now where we've we've lived within structure for long enough that we we have the right and we have the ability to break out of that structure, not for the sake of breaking out, but for the sake of a more integrative, rewarding, sensical experience of you know, what we have built together over time? Because I think that, like, that's something that people don't really understand, is that,

20:55
you know, if everything is everything,

20:58
if we are

21:00
whole, if we are one, then

21:06
we, all of us, built this together over time.

21:18
In everything that you see,

21:21
there is a piece of you

21:24
because it is you,

21:32
then there are no

21:35
there are no parts of you that do not belong. There are only parts of you that are in the wrong place, just like some things need to be left behind. Need to be left by time in an old pattern and the archives of the past and the beautiful fractal field of information that we have available to build from and to

22:07
honor with our

22:09
Attention and our acknowledgement.

22:22
I and to reference to continue building

23:03
each individual moment that we experience, every decision that we make, across time until the end of time, if

23:19
there is an end of time, what

23:20
but

23:25
when the patterns stop needing to be measured, when the patterns stop unfolding? When does the causality process? When does cause and effect end? It can't, so I guess there can't be an end of time. But anyway, you know, I think that when people really start to see that we are kind of like submerged in reality, rather than these independent particles floating through space, it's

24:01
like open empty space. We're all alone and not connected

24:06
to anything, and our internal experience is closed off and cold and lonely. When people realize that your internal experience is pulling from everything that exists and how you interpret

24:23
it. And everything that exists

24:28
exists due to interpretation,

24:31
due to a decision making process of

24:35
whether it would or would not,

24:39
whether it could or could not, like

24:46
I think it will just be a different place. You know what I mean? Like,

24:52
when people realize you can't stop feeling things, you're

24:56
feeling things all the time.

25:01
You're you're just feeling them from a different angle.

25:08
It's like you're,

25:13
your experience.

25:16
It is just flowing differently,

25:20
but it's still experience
